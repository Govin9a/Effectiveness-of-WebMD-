    "### Background and Motication: \n",
    "- We are all pursuing our Masters within Biomedical Informatics, so technology within biology and medicine is very interesting to us. We ultimately want to utilize our skills to better improve efficiency within health as well as how biological data is analyzed. This project will allow us to apply what we’ve learned to solve a problem that not only aligns with our interests but also is very practical within the field. \n",
    "- We are trying to address the issue of drug interactions and adverse effects. According to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adverse drug events (ADEs) account for over 1 million emergency department visits and 280,000 hospitalizations each year in the United States. By developing a drug recommendation system that takes into account a patient's medical history, allergies, and current medications, healthcare providers can potentially reduce the risk of ADEs and improve patient outcomes.\n",
    "- The field of biomedical informatics is rapidly growing, and there is a need for innovative solutions to address healthcare challenges. By working on projects such as this one, individuals can gain valuable experience in data analysis, machine learning, and healthcare informatics, which may lead to future career opportunities in the field.\n"

    "### Project Objectives:\n",
    "- The primary objective of this project is to develop a drug recommendation system using machine learning and data scraped from WebMD. We aim to provide a personalized drug recommendation based on the patient’s medical history, allergies and current medication. \n",
    "- The primary question that we try to answer through this project is: What are the most effective features to include in the drug recommendation system to ensure accuracy and personalized recommendation. \n",
    "- How can data scraped from WebMD be preprocessed and analyzed to develop a drug recommendation system. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Project Aims to accomplish the following:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts drug interactions and adverse effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Evaluate the performance of the drug recommendation system using various metrics, such as accuracy and recall. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Identify the most important features to include in the drug recommendation system to ensure accuracy and personalized recommendation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The benefit of this project are as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Improve patient outcomes by reducing risk of adverse drug events and interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Enhance healthcare provider decision-making by providing personalized drug recommendations based on patient-specific factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased knowledge and understanding of machine learning techniques and their applications in healthcare informatics. "

    "\n",

We will need to sort through which posts contain enough information to be included in our analyses, and also determine how many are necessary to build a successful model, as we will need both training and testing data. From our model we will be able to analyze the RSS and R-squared values to determine how successful our model is. If time, we would also like to perform cross-validation on the model to determine the most successful model based on the data we have. \n",
