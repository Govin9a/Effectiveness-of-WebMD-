It helps me with a lot of things, my attentiveness and focus of course, but also my anxiety and ability to socialize; I used to be a complete ""wallflower"" as they say, and a recluse. With the help of this medication I've overcome many of my mental illnesses.

Now for the negative: I get center chest pains, I'm not entirely sure if it's caused by Adderall XR. However, the chest pain which comes and goes is typically a mild ache type irritant. On the other hand, I had a ""freak"" heart attack at the age of 24 due to two of my heart ventricles clotting 100% and 90%. I nearly died, they did  a cardiac cath procedure through the the groin to poke out the clots. I made a full recovery. The doctor didn't even put in stents. This event was PRIOR to be being prescribed Adderall XR. They could not figure out the cause of the clots, as my blood had showed no proof of clotting disorder. I am no doctor but my guess would be it was caused by using hard street drugs for multiple years from about the ages of 15-20. But nobody including me will ever know for sure.

I do get increased blood pressure, and heart rate, however, it almost always goes away as long as I become physically active. However, if I am sitting around lounging, or say... just driving around... I tend to notice not only the rise in blood pressure, the shakes, as well as the mild center chest pain.

I would say I am worried about this causing me serious heart/cardiovascular complications, if it hasn't already. I do not know how serious center chest pain is, I've always heard it's the left arm you should worry about, which, aside from some nerve damage from the heart procedure (which I take Gabapentin for) which also preceded the Adderall prescription.

Should I be worried? I feel like I can't truly live without being on Adderall, I don't ever over take my prescribed dose (no abusing.) However, I feel like it could be a risk to my heart healh. It's a bit of a catch-22. But I think I'd rather risk dying, than living as I used to. Which was essentially a life of nothingness, and uselessness. At least now I can work, socialize, pay attention/focus.  I'm afraid to tell my doctor, because I don't want to Adderall to be taken away. I am hoping someone here with some medical expertise can shine some light on my situation.Read More Read Less",Wellbutrin XL oral

I was diagnosed with epilepsy ten years ago. I was on 500 mg of keppra a day. It didn’t affect me with the side effects until years later when I started to become suicidal, depressed, having my brain foggy and not able to think fast enough. I started a path to reduce my medications due to the fact that I didn’t have seizures but my neurologist said I should take Keppra reducing slow unfortunately. My next appointment is in November with a new neurologist and it wasn’t until I saw my primary doctor and talked with my pharmacists hat they agreed I could go off of the 250 mg over a nine week period since it’s been in my body for ten years. 
And since I started reducing I’ve been back to normal almost uncanny.  
I hope this helped anyone. Maybe if your neurologist doesn’t want to reduce it at least reach out to primary care or pharmacy if you have one, because reducing mine I’ve gone back to basically my normal self. Yes I’m still on two other epilepsy meds but I’m decreasing Keppra. 
I could list the bad side effect Keppra gave me but reading Keppra Rage I’m pretty sure everyone can figure it out. 
I was at a subthreaputic level and basically my doctor/pharmacist thought it was doing more harm than good and not preventing seizures as do my other seizure drugs with less side effects.

Keppra was a disaster. Its effects on personality, mentality and memory of my son were horrible. The strange thing was that all the neurologists we met had a common consensus that Keppra is the safest anti-epileptic. After two years of suffering with this drug, I went against all the neurologists well and stopped giving my son this drug and his personality, mentality and memory recovered significantly. The side effects of this drug had to be investigated and studied well before          prescribing it to the patients.Read More Read Less",

Then stopped so we increased to 500, then to 750, then to 1,000 (all 2x a day). The 1,000 made me break in a full body rash, so we went to 500. In the hospital, after back to back seizures in a day, they put me on IV 750.  Well, now my rash is back, but even worse.  Plus, I am incredibly depressed, to the point I’ve thought of suicide… and I cry daily.  I can’t stand this medication, but getting into my neurologist is brutal. 
It has not stopped my seizures at all, and I have no memory after any of them.

This drug needs to stop being subscribed as the go-to for epilepsy. My husband has nocturnal epilepsy with SEVERE convulsions, to the point where his shoulders dislocate and the sockets break. Not only did Keppra not control his seizures at all, but it destroyed him mentally. Completely changed his personality. Keppra rage is a real thing and no one warned us. He went from having the personality of a human golden retriever to being constantly angry and severely depressed. He said his mind felt broken. His personality completely changed to the point where it almost broke our relationship, because he was so dismissive and mean. After 6 months of hell, we got the doctor to finally take him off Keppra. Now, he's completely back to his normal, happy self AND his seizures are controlled. Unbelievable how horrible and ineffective Keppra was. I've met 3 other people who were also prescribed Keppra for their epilepsy, SAME THING - ineffective or barely effective, rage, depression. There needs to be more awareness on how severe the personality changes can be if its going to continue to be so widely prescribed. Read More Read Less",

99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,jh1955 ,55-64 ,Male ,On medication for 6 months to less than 1 year ,Patient,Convulsive Seizures ,3.0,"Less than a month after my 35th birthday, I went to my Dr because I had a breast lump and was also having really intense pain in my right ribs and lower back. I had tripped in my backyard a few months prior and figured that's what the pain was and since I was only 35 I figured the lump was just a benign cyst that would go away. Turns out it was more serious. A LOT more serious. After a mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy I was diagnosed with breast cancer. After surgery and a full body pet scan I was diagnosed stage 4 as the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes and my bones. I can't begin to describe what it feels like to have cancer eating away at your bones but it is a pain so intense that without OxyContin, I probably would not want to go on living. It's been a little over 3 years since my diagnosis and because of this medication I have been able to actually have a decent quality of life. I'm not even 40 and I have 3 children who need me. Without OxyContin my kids wouldn't have a mother, they'd have a shell of a human. I would be bedridden and miserable. That is not how I want my kids to remember me.

My only complaint? The occasional pharmacy technicians who treat me like a piece of trash drug addicted junkie. It's absolutely shocking that anyone would treat a stage 4 cancer patient like trash for being on this medication. If you work in a pharmacy, please, get to know your customers that take this medication. Metastatic breast cancer can be and in my case is an ""invisible Illness"". You wouldn't be able to tell that I have terminal cancer just by looking at me and because of that I have had a few awful experiences while picking up my prescription. Don't assume. I am 38 now but I look about 28. Please treat people with kindness because the customer you're judging might not look sick on the outside when in reality they might be living with terminal cancer. A terminal cancer patient should NEVER be made to feel like some sort of junkie. This medicine is literally meant for people like me.

Other than the stigma and occasional judgement, when taken as prescribed and for legitimate reasons this medicine is truly amazing and let's me have a decent quality of life while I'm still living. Read More Read Less",

But, because the Pharmaceutical Companies and the FDA’s lack of proper warning about the high potential for permanent chronic nerve, tendon, muscular, neurological, etc, damages, I have now, as of 2012, been victimized by their lack of due diligence to protect me, you, even our pets from ALL FQ Antibiotics, All Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics. They are only now finally requiring there to be further black box warnings of the potential permanent damages, and only now recommending they be reserved for ONLY the most life threatening illnesses, not reoccurring UTI’s, Sinus Infections, & other much less severe illnesses. To date, MANY Drs STILL believe the potential for damages is rare. When in fact, the Research is proving otherwise. Unfortunately, too late for many of us. And to literally add insult to the Injuries Big Pharma, & our FDA have allowed to happen to me/us, NOW they are trying to take away some of the FEW meds that actually gives us some pain relief & QUALITY of LIFE! No one is arguing that the Meds are being abused by some. BUT, research is PROVING that MOST Chronic Pain Patients ARE taking our Meds responsibly, being carefully managed by our Drs, & following strict protocol. YET, despite being responsible patients, who research shows benefit from this and the similar meds, OUR Government is working to take away these Quality of Life Giving Meds rapidly, whipping up a media frenzy about the “Crisis”. When the majority of the overdose cases are of people who obtain meds illegally. And, it is suspected the other money making reason for removing these Beneficial Meds, is really so the Pharma Co’s can force us to use the NEW, improved version of Pain Med they have to offer us, less addictive they say. Conveniently leaving out the fact that these Meds are FAR more expensive! My review is a warning that IF U take away these LIFE GIVING Meds, the SUICIDE RATE WILL increaseRead More Read Less",

But I am 60 years old and yes I know I am dependent but I would rather be dependent on these than sitting in my chair or bed all day, wanting to do something but just don't have the energy to deal with the pain as it comes from doing some chores, or even gardening.  This medication last longer than the Oxycodone's but no they take me off of these.  Now, I know there is a crisis, but it's the illegal fentanyl that is coming into our country that is killing people.  The doctors have stopped prescribing these meds to everyone, so why do the people with chronic pain have to be taken off of them when we do everything that our doctors ask of us.  This is not a One Size Fits All solution, we are all different.  I don't take them for a tooth ache or a pulled muscle.  I can't turn my neck because my C2,C3,C4 are so bad.  I have stabbing pains, pins and needles, have had a nerve burned but it's back again and arthritis in my knees.  I don't like what they are doing to us, but at 60 years old, I feel like I don't have any more good years left.  People were dying of heroin in the 60's and it didn't get this far.  Something has to be done, because we all can't go off these meds, there will be more suicides than ever, people will want to die instead of dealing with every minute pain.

128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anonymous ,19-24 ,Female ,On medication for 6 months to less than 1 year ,Patient,Seizures with Irregular Muscle Contractions ,5.0,"I started this medication for anxiety. Not only did it work on my anxiety like nothing else had for 30 years of different treatments, it also brought to light that I was so anxious that I had lost my libido. I thought it was due to other factors but, once my anxiety was under control, my libido came back. I wish that doctors would understand that for some people, not all, the benefits outweigh the risks. I am able to take this as needed and not every day and it had changed my life 180 degrees. I believe that because I don't take it every day, I'm not seeing the withdrawal or addiction issues.  Nobody will prescribe it, even on an as needed basis. I finally found something that works after medication roulette for 30+ years and everyone is too scared of the opioid crisis to deal with people on a case by case basis. I really hate Healthcare and the way it is run.
They will pump me full of drugs with terrible side effects that I have to take everyday and say that they take months to work instead of this drug, which works within a hour and I don't need everyday.Read More Read Less",

When it works, it works fast and well. My most recent experience was with bronchitis that developed into a general UR infection that kept hanging on for a month, with a continuing cough, fever, and accompanying body aches that were unresponsive to anything but maximum doses of aspirin and codeine. Tests for influenza and covid-19 were repeatedly negative. Finally my PCP decided to try amoxicillin experimentally for a so-far unidentified bacterial infection. About a half hour after my first dose, my body aches vanished, my face was slightly flushed, and I felt so normal it was almost euphoric. This is the fastest response I can remember, though at least two other times when I had severe bacterial infections something similar happened after about an hour. I've never had any serious side effects. This drug works for me against bacteria, and when it turns out the infection was viral and the drug has no effect, I usually know that within a few hours of my first dose.Read More Read Less",

199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Karl ,45-54 ,Male ,On medication for less than 1 month ,Patient,Chronic Pain ,4.0,"Methadone helped me get my life back. I had lost my job because I was withdrawing so bad, my boss sent me home. I had just started methadone but I wasn't up to a dose that was working for me yet and that morning I went to the clinic, took my dose, got a couple blocks down the road and had to pull over and puke. I tried to work but it was apparent I couldn't. Once I got to a steady dose at 84mg, I got another job and was doing much better. The last year or so I've been extremely depressed due to my degenerative nerve disorder (Charcot Marie-Tooth). It's gotten to really affect my daily life due to having trouble standing/walking and I've been unemployed for close to a year. I'd love to work but I can't just go get any job anymore and I had a few interviews in a field that is my dream job. Yet, I couldn't abide by some of their guidelines due to my disability like wearing gloves, wearing certain shoes, standing for hours, etc... I used to be able to do these things but my disability is only getting worse unfortunately. Lately I've been trying to lower my doses so I'm not tied down to the clinic. Thankfully, I don't use anything else or drink so I only have to go once a month for my doses, where I used to have to go every morning until I had enough clean drug tests. I dropped down to 70mg and was on that for close to a year (I started going to the clinic around 3 years ago). Now, I'm at 62mg. I wanted to go down 4mg a month, but I didn't lower it last time due to how bad my depression/anxiety again. I think I'll be better off without it, but I just need to stay where I am if I feel awful everyday. I can deal with some slight withdrawal but when it gets bad I just need to remind myself I don't always have to go down. I can do it when I feel up to it. I just will never go back up. Methadone is amazing for those looking to get clean. I was tired of waiting all day to hear back from my dealer and then when I hear my text bell go off I get all excited only to find out it was an email or dude telling me it would be tomorrow. That feeling is really awful. There are those people who abuse the clinic and get to as high a dose as possible to chase a high. They'll be at 200mg and complain about being sick 4-5 hours after dosing. It is great to those looking to feel normal and then slowly decrease until you're off completely.Read More Read Less",

I hate to say it but you are still taking an addictive drug and at that many mgs you have to be feeling pretty darn good. I know these people don't want to hear that but it's the truth, you're just trading one addiction for another. I had no problem coming off this drug as my dosage was very low.

Im so glad they synthesized this drug for humanity. It has helped millions. All drugs should be decriminalized and we need to educate the youth about the dangers. Your always going to have people who abuse drugs illegal or not.  Why not make it safe, pure and leave it up to the individual. After all it is our body. Nobody would have to rob or steal from their love ones and the power that drugs give the cartels and criminals would be crushed. Let's work together to do what's right for humanity.

202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unfadable1 ,25-34 ,Male ,On medication for 1 to less than 2 years ,Patient,Prevention of Opiate Drug Abuse ,4.7,"I started using this medication as I could no longer get prescribed Oxycodone due to a severe addiction and I was terrified of the opiate withdrawals. All I can say is WOW! First dose was 6mg and it stopped all my cravings for endone and I had no pain either. My doctor slowly increased my dose until I was on 21mg a day but I found that to be too high of a dose. I was nodding off at all times of the day and was struggling to stay awake past 5pm daily. I was also sleeping for 12 hours a night. So I asked my doctor to lower my dose. I am currently down to 18mg a day and still lowering my dose by 1mg per week as I really want to get off Methadone soon. I don't want to be reliant on it for the rest of my life. Even though I do suffer from chronic pain due to a failed spinal surgery, I don't want to be on methadone for the rest of my life. I just want to be clean and know that I do not need to be on any strong pain killers and that I can just maintain my pain with Panadol. I do highly recommend this drug for anyone with an addiction to opiates and who has chronic pain because methadone really does help with both of those issues but it is not a long term solution. Even though some people can be on it for decades, it really is not a good drug for your body long term. It can cause stomach ulcers, acne, severe dry skin, dry scalp/worse dandruff (if you had dandruff before taking this medication), tooth decay, constipation, difficulty urinating, lowered sex drive, depression, anxiety, loss of appetite, nausea, just to name a few. So by all means, start this medication as a short term solution and hopefully it helps you like it has helped me and we can all get off of using this medication with the least amount of side effects/withdrawals as possible.Read More Read Less",

It’s a tried and tested product been used since the nazis run low on morphine and time and time again has always been the most understood safest no dangerous side effects I’ve experienced because is been tried and tested even before the Germans invaded Poland. There are other subutex, espanol and besponol now out with hardly any long term testing. It’s hit and miss and no fentonyl is now in the scene the blockers have no chance in preventing or blocking this new high potent drug. I feel it’s time to embrace the opiate and put the dealers out of business. Done in a safe clean environment the criminal element can be eliminated the drug controlled and due to its purity there will be no side effects as it’s the agents it’s cut with cause the real problems. Look to Switzerland and the 40% decrease in drug crime over night. Why spend government money on chasing the dealers when money can be saved or made keep patients safe and clean put them into work, educate the young impressionable leave it to the individual to come of opiates but best of all put them criminals out of business.

It gets into your bones. I was on 100mg for years and when i left and when went back I was on 53mg for the remaining 3 years Ann's noticed no difference. I could have been on a lower dose the entire time. It helped, however I wish I hadn't allowed myself to stay on it so long. I recommend if you need it please only makes it a temporary thing. It helped me out of my funk but it's not necessary for several years of long term use. Just be strong and realize you don't need a permanent crutch. It'll just hold you back in the long run. It did to me. And I'm happier off of methadone now than I was the past 9 years.

Insomnia was another symptom, but yeah overall the symptoms I had before was way worse when I got on these for only two days which I called the DR and was able to get off them despite some mild anxiety and “brain zaps”, gas too. It just didn’t work to help me and I personally just recommend anything without medication since it’s dangerous to take meds involving the brain than any other part of the body.

I was prescribed 10mg Celexa daily for anxiety, and started off by taking 5mg for 8 days to start. On the 9th day, I took 10 mg (keep in mind this is the minimum dosage) and I had a complete overdose and nervous system reaction. It started with what felt like my skin burning, I had emptied my guts from diarrhea in about 20 minutes, my legs were stiff, my anxiety was through the roof, my heart was racing, and I had insane shivers. The worst symptom was the skin burning and I felt like my skin was on fire while I was shivering. I went to the hospital and turns out my blood pressure was dangerously high, being 171 over 110. They gave me 2mg of lorazepam and within 10 minutes I was knocked out, and after a little bit of sleeping myself and my blood pressure were back to normal. It was definitely scary, but I do not regret taking it. I don't know if the Celexa truly helped me or not, but shortly after that incident my anxiety started to go away, and I rarely have anxiety attacks anymore. When I do I just take .5 mg of lorazepam.

228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,YellowMellowOrWhatever ,19-24 ,Female ,On medication for 1 to 6 months ,Patient,Panic Disorder ,5.0,"I always struggled with anxiety and depression, but I lived with it for years. During the spring of 2021 I began having horrible panic attacks every time I left my house. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, and I cried nonstop. Nothing really triggered this but it might have been a result of the pandemic. Before this, I had a job where I traveled across the country months on end and was fine but then my anxiety completely changed me. I couldn’t leave my bed room without having a panic attack. I stopped seeing friends, going out…I couldn’t even work or go see the doctor. I finally ended up at urgent care after a bad episode where they gave me hydroxozine but that made it worse. FINALLY I got in to see a doctor and he prescribed me 10mg Celexa.
I’m going to honest, at first it was awful. I would say the first 2-3 weeks I didn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat so I lost a ton of weight, and I felt jittery and anxious 24/7. My doctor encouraged me to stick with it and give it a month or two. He also gave me trazadone to help with sleeping. I remember coming on here and reading all the reviews and feeling defeated because I thought it wasn’t going to work.
After around a month I started to notice a difference. I wasn’t waking up in a panic, my brain fog went away, I wasn’t feeling jittery or anxious 24/7. It was gradual, I didn’t just wake up and feel better one day. I also went to therapy which helped a lot. And around month 3 they moved me to 20mg.  I’ve been on it for over a year now and it truly has changed my
life. I feel like myself again. I go out, I have fun, and I rarely if ever have panic attacks. Things that would make me anxious before my
panic disorder don’t bother me anymore. I feel levelheaded and more myself than ever.
So if you’re worried about starting or have started and feel bad, stick with it!!!! Work with your doctors and don’t stay up late in the night like I did reading every negative review you can find. Celexa has really really helped me and I’m so happy to be on it. Read More Read Less",

I have been slowly decreasing my dosage over the years and now take 10mg per day, and that is enough to keep the trouble at bay. I haven't had a single episode since starting Celexa.  I also exercise daily to keep the stress low and eat a healthy diet. 

I know not every medicine works well for every person, but Celexa is certainly one worth trying if your doctor recommends it. Please don't give up hope. Keep trying, and you will find something that is right for you!Read More Read Less",

I went from being able to hold a job to now being on psychiatric disability. I have tried weaning off this medication and all these effects become 100x worse.

238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anonymous ,25-34 ,Male ,On medication for 1 to 6 months ,Patient,Repeated Episodes of Anxiety ,5.0,"at first, Celexa was my saving grace. It pulled me out of a very dark point in my life. slowly after 6 months, it stopped working, and then began working against me. it intensified my symptoms of depression. I went from feeling full of life to more suicidal than I'd ever been before. I started sleeping for upwards of 16 hours a day. I stopped attending school and when I did I slept in class. I slept, not because I was fatigued, but because I didn't want to be awake. Sleep was the closest I could get to death without hurting anyone. I'd wake up angry that I didn't die in my sleep. I dreamt about killing myself. I'd never before wanted to die so badly. this effect made me not want to take it at all. I'd talk to my doctor and he'd up my dose and contact me 2 weeks later to check in. Usually I was doing better. but after a month, I was back in the same pattern of living without wanting to live. this happened 3 times, and after the third time, my doctor had to take me off of it because I was so miserable and depressed that I didn't even realize it was the fault of the medication and instead blamed myself for being too depressed to be helped. Personally, I would not recommend Celexa to anyone. Read More Read Less",

I had surgery in 2008 to remove a large mass, but it was not successful. Then had a spinal tap to drain the fluid which ended up causing nerve pain in my right leg. So I have was prescibed Hydrocodone/APAP, and if not for this medication, I would no longer be able to work or have a normal life. I have found several doctors that I have been fortunate to care for me but now have either retired or left because of those people who abuse such medications and now it is hard to find a doctor who will prescibe it. I was on a number of pain medications percocet 10/325, 5/325 but ended up on Hydrocodone/APAP 7.5/325 since 2013, I take it as directed and only as directed. I understand that the laws governing this medication are very strict, but I believe if you have cronic pain above a level 5 with proof of condition, you should be able to recieve this medication without the doctor treating you like your a drug abuser! I have tried the Epidural Injections, Joint Injections, Physical Therapy (which made it worse), exersize, and many other things, but the Hydrocodone/APAP and the other meds in combination with that are the only thing that has been able to keep me working and living a full and happy life. I work full-time and have my own business. In addition to that I have nephews and godchildren I love to pick up and spend with, and I can only do that because of my medication. I am just hoping and praying I am to find a doctor like the ones I was blessed to have in previous years without having to be a genie pig being experimented on with pain pumps, spinal cord stimulators (which have caused severe damage for many patients).Read More Read Less",

It is a poor drug for pain control for moderate to severe pain. Oxycodone works better for that type of pain. There isn't much to offer for mild pain since they took Darvon off the market years ago.
Many people relied on that medication for pain and many, many people took it without problems. It was taken off the market for some type of heart related problems as I understand it. So many people did not have heart problems though.

Ask the pharmacy what company is producing the pills before I buy them, and if my physician won't give me a pill for pill exchange deal, get a new doctor; because he probably knows what his pharmacy is doing. I called Medicare, they had me also call a patient advocate. But my guess is not doing anything is bad news waiting to happen. I had surgery for a crushed disk.

The Mallinckrodt hydrocodone as of 2022 is completely different and is now 5 times weaker then it was originally. With all the legal problems and lawsuits that Mallinckrodt has been under. I'm pretty sure it has a big reason on why Mallinckrodt has reformulated their Hydrocodone and why it's so weak..  The two main things that I noticed was that now the pills have a shiny coat to them and that the pills are hard when you chew them. The old Mallinckrodt hydrocodone pills had a powdered look to them and was soft and very easy to chew. These new mallinckrodt hydrocodone pills have a hard shiny glossy look and when you chew them, they crush up like like hard candy.

290,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JLD ,75 or over ,Male ,On medication for 10 years or more ,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ,4.0,"I was on Actos for 5 years.  Unbelievably, my doc put me on it only 6 months after I had a heart attack, in spite of the warnings about cardiac side effects.  It did keep my A1C down below 7, taken with metformin and glimiperide.  But I have suffered severe, debilitating leg and muscle pain.  But I never made the connection to Actos; I thought it was related to neuropathy and problems with my spine.  In May of this year my A1C was creeping up above 7, so my doc told me to increase my Actos dose to 45 mg from 30.  Within a month I became short of breath and had crackling sounds in my lungs when I breathed.  I just thought I had bronchitis and waited it out.  I also had terrible swelling in my ankles and feet, and then I broke a toe, too.  In Sept I was to return to the doctor and the night before, I began to wonder if the Actos could be causing the swelling.  Sure enough...I read all the warnings, and realized that I was well on my way to congestive heart failure!!!  I stopped taking Actos that morning.  Much of the swelling has gone down.  And my legs stopped hurting!!!  This drug has made my life hell for 5 years.Read More Read Less",

If it wasn't all over in roughly ten minutes, it was finished anyway because my junk was useless; which wasn't fair on my partners.    I had a consultation with an online Doctor who prescribed 10mg as needed; however I went against my Doctor's advice and took 2.5mg daily (which I was later informed was fine as the drug may need to be adjusted to suit your tolerance and your sexual activity).  I wanted my body to get use to the medications first.  I have continued to take 2.5mg daily and if I know I may have a sexual encounter, I take 5mg.  No side effects what-so-ever on this dose; however I went to an orgy one night so took 10mg and experienced some facial flushing and felt hot; which didn't bother me.  End result; 2.5mg daily and 5mg for sexual encounters works well for me; however now I have the opposite problem it takes me some time to ejaculate...well it's not really a problem, however if I want a quickie, it can take some time to blow.

After 4 weeks i do feel better and after 8 weeks i feel much better. I feel like my old self again. There are days where i feel down and the odd intrusive thought but this drug really has helped me live a normal life.
NO drug will ever get rid of your problems completely, but they will help reduce your symptoms and not consume your mind.

Remember you are not alone, good luck with your journey and remember..

Give Citalopram at least 8 weeks and if you do not feel better, speak to your GP.

Then Effexor SNRI and that made me anxious. I started taking citalopram 15 y ago. It's by far the best of these 3 with a better profile if you miss a dose. 

Note: Scientology hate mental health drugs. You should be a spectical of 1 star reviews as this is a know activity of Scientologists. And from I read here, pretty poor writers making insane claims that are deliberately negative and pretty clearly over the top.

I know 5 people taking this drug, it's a cognitive enhancer and it has assisted all 5 of us to make better life choices.

Finally, I decided that things just couldn't get any worse, why not just try it and STOP if there was no improvement? Now I'm at the 3 week point. I never had any horrible side effects, just some dry mouth, waking up about an hour earlier than the alarm, and sometimes my heart will feel like it's pounding. My anxiety is 90 percent gone. I take this pill when the dr advised: around 6pm (because I have other medications and I need to space things out). Everyone's experience is different, but if you and your dr have determined that this might help you, it's worth a try.Read More Read Less",

I intend to gradually ease off of it, despite it being really, really helpful. 
I had major stress with life trauma, hence l could not sleep more than two hours a night, lost weight and couldn’t go out of the house - it was horrific.
My doctor, helped me even though it was only by phone calls, and suggested an anti depressant.
I did feel, as he had warned me ,
that l may feel unpleasant for the first few days.
Yes, l did, but after a few days l started to feel normal as l was able to sleep!
I gained my confidence back, sleep like a log, 7 or 8 hours a night ( Sleep Station ) my doctor put me in touch with them online - and am generally okay. 
So I would say thanks
 to my doctor and to the treatment that worked!  I do try to stay strong and as a senior keep moving and busy.
Walk every day

346,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Carol ,55-64 ,Female ,On medication for less than 1 month ,Patient,Panic Disorder ,1.0,"Every year or so I have chronic spells of panic disorder. These usually last for 4/5 months but are at there peak from a month to 3 months. My main symptom is dizziness which makes me afraid to do even the most simple of tasks, in fear of passing out. Even a simple 1 to 1 conversation can have me fighting to stay conscious. Anyway, citalopram. Currently on my second spell with this medication and here's my experience. On 10mg, Days 1 and 2, really sick, could hardly eat. Days 3 and 4, borderline unbearable. Felt so dizzy it was a struggle to even go to the toilet. From around a week the side effects slowly started to pass but the anxiety was alot higher than it was before medication. After around 2 weeks the heightened anxiety passed and I was feeling similar to how I was pre medication. Between weeks 2 and 3, I started to notice I felt more calm, my eating had picked up and my mind was racing. I was no longer pre meditating the worst outcome in every situation, though I was still getting the odd moment of unnecessary anxiety. Dr decided to move me up to 20mg. I was fearful at first, because the side effects were so severe on 10mg and I had to take time off work. I've been on 20mg for a week now and I feel like I'm getting closer to being my old self again, and as an added bonus, absolutely no side effects at all from the upping of dosage. All these feelings are very similar to the 1st time I took citalopram. They make you feel disgusting to begin with, even I wanted to stop after a few days despite knowing from before that this was normal and that it would help me in the long run. Give it a chance. This pill helps me when I'm at my lowest and I plan on staying on it alot longer this time. Book a few weeks off work, don't make any plans at all and ride out the storm. It will get better, I promise. Good luck to everyone fighting mental illness, it really is hard and I hope you find peace soon.Read More Read Less",

On this day I actually sat down and was able to let the kids play without thinking something terrible was going to happen. Over the last 16 years the dose has slowly increased from 10mg up to 40mg.

I was on it from 2017 - 2021 and felt so good that I thought I could wean myself off. After a few months off the medication, I once again felt hopeless, tired, and lost all motivation to enjoy life.

352,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dave ,19-24 ,Male ,On medication for 1 to 6 months ,Patient,Repeated Episodes of Anxiety ,1.0,"Citalopram has been so good for chilling me out. I initially took it for anxiety, but realized relatively soon afterwards that I was so much more content with life on this medication. I don't suffer boredom anywhere near as badly as I used to, and boredom for me led me to do things like drink too much alcohol which I have since completely removed from my life. Almost 4 years now as a non-drinker. My wife has noticed huge improvement regarding my general level of contentment.

One draw back; I'm almost always tired. It definitely makes me more fatigued even when I get to bed before 10pm each night. That said, the alternative to not being on Citalopram is far worse for me so it's a side effect I'll happily put up with.Read More Read Less",

I started Ambien the first time when I was 17, the 5mg dose. It was like a miracle after about 9 years of trying tons of different things, it was the only thing that made me sleep, I didn't have to overdose on, and didn't make me feel like crap the next day. But for me, having to take it every single night made me build a tolerance to it and it stopped working. I got upped to the 10mg and all hell broke loose. I was having full blown conversations with my mom that I could only vaguely remember. One time I woke up with candy wrappers all around me and again only vaguely remember eating all of them. I'm 100% sure if I didn't live with my parents, I would have tried to sleep-drive.
I got taken off of it and tried a few things for a couple years but then just kinda suffered for a while before asking my doctor to put me back on it. Now almost 10 years after first starting Ambien, the 5mg dose does nothing for me. It makes my eyes feel tired and I feel like I'm in a fog but that's it. I'm too afraid to go up to 10mg (if my doc would even let me) because there's nothing stopping me from sleep-driving. Literally my worst fear is sleep-driving and end up killing someone.

I just wish this medication was a little stronger so that I would be able to stay asleep during the night. I also have severe anxiety and depression that keeps me awake and keeps my mind racing. I’m currently working on that. Maybe when I get my other issues under control that would help my sleep situation. One awful thing about this medication is that If I am without it for one night, I will be awake all night, I have actually been awake for 4 or 5 days at a time with terrible insomnia. I won’t even be tired, it is brutal, so I am careful not to ever let me prescription run out.

It may be a common side effect but it feels 100x worse than any insomnia, and dont know if it will go away. 
I feel no love for my pets, cant watch tv or listen to music, cant go out, cant work, cant find anything to do, no Interest in improving my life wich i need and terrible boredom. Its 100x worse than any insomnia and very very hard to even live. Any doctor who would prescribe this without discussing these risks to the patient isnt very good. It brings upon suicidal thoughts, and ruins your life. Since insomnia usually isnt permanent, and the side effects of ambien can be, it's common sense to be very cautious with this drug. Emotional blunting may seem like an easy word to say, but it means no joy in your life. No joy is no life! Its not just a temporary effect that will go away in a few days.

My Mother suffers from Lewy Body Dementia.  Out of nowhere she one day got into the car and started driving and the police found her three hours away.  We knew something wasn't quite right before but that was the beginning of our real battle with dementia.  Since that event her cognitive ability declined immediately and she was put on Namenda (5mg).  At first I thought it might be helping, but she was on Aricept as well.  She seemed more cognizant of conversation and what was going on around her, but this was short lived.  She was upped to 10mg, then 14mg, and then a staggering jump to 28mg.  I was away for the month that this jump took place and when I returned home to look after my mother I could not believe what I saw.  She was borderline catatonic.  The light was gone from her eyes and it was almost as if the muscles in her face had fallen into paralysis leaving her with a constant scowl.  She never smiled and 90% of her speech was repetition of a single phrase.  She refused showers, became combative, refused food, and wanted only to lie in bed and be left alone.  She began loosing control of her bowels and would kick and scratch and fight you when you attempted to change them.  My sweet, loving mother was all but gone and I had no hope that I would ever see her again.  She would not change clothes or even remove her shoes to sleep.  It was heartbreaking.  I pulled the drug immediately as it was the suspected culprit.  I was angry she'd been given it into decline.  She was on it for a month and a half maybe, it took about that long for her to come around.  Her smile returned, her gentle spirit, and loving nature gradually surfaced and she was again happy to go into the world with us.  She no longer fights over changing clothes, shoes, depends and welcomes the help.  However, there has been cognitive decline that never returned and it's hard to say if it was the drug or disease progression. Read More Read Less",

After and during 1 month's use of Namenda, the drug not only didn't help his memory but was hurting his equilibrium, made him shakey, and exhausted, and very off balance. We were more worried about him falling than his memory! He had a hard time getting form the his chair to the bedroom. We got him a walker. It got so severe, we talked to his doctor who said it was okay to take him off the Namenda. I would not recommend this drug to anyone. I believe it was toxic for my father. He is doing better now after being off of it for almost a month. Even goes out to get the paper, now.Read More Read Less",

I went to my doctor and was prescribed Acyclovir at 800mg 3 times a day. I took the meds for only one day. I woke up the next morning with my eye swelled shut. I immediately returned to my doctor. He suggested the shingles was causing my swollen eye. He said the shingles must be moving faster. He double my dosage from 800mg 3 times a day to 1600mg 3 times a day. 
I took that dosage for 2 days. The night of the second day I realized I was having problems forming thoughts. It progress until my mind couldn’t form a thought. I began to lose my speech. I became panicked to the point of almost hysterical. I began crying, my husband became afraid. I kept trying to speak but I couldn’t! Could not form a thought except panic. All this happened in less than an hour. I was rushed to the ER. They immediately assumed a stroke. My speech soon slowly returned as the medication was wearing off. All the test for stroke came back negative. ER doctor was frustrated and finally said it may be the medication but doubted it. I was given an IV to flush the medication from my symptom. In about an hour all my symptoms were completely gone. I was told to stop the medication immediately. The doctors refused to admit it was the Acyclovir that caused my lose of speech and ability to form thoughts. I’m writing this because this is a very rare side effect that’s hidden from patients, but it can happen. I have never been so terrified in my life!

Then I went on 500 mg once a day maintenance but this did not fully control it. Here's what did: I split the 500 mg tab and took 1/2 the tab twice a day.  I got the idea from rereading the patient instructions for the full dose; they say it is important to maintain an even level of the medicine in your blood, so take it evenly spaced during the day, i.e. not all at once. Knock on wood, haven't had a recurrence in years.  Another thing I found out by experience: when I was having outbreaks I could get rid of them much faster using the medicine plus just enough sunlight to darken my skin only a little.  Complicated to arrange when they are on genitalia, but worth the effort.  For people with fair skin that can mean only a one or two minutes of sunlight.  That will help plenty.Read More Read Less",

412,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Blueskygal ,65-74 ,,On medication for 1 to 6 months ,Patient,Prevent Shingles in Patients Without a Normal Immune System ,2.3,"July 10, 2020  I reviewed below “Rey Mundo”, but inadvertently hit the wrong level of stars and failed to mention a couple of important points.    If you have shingles for longer than expected, there is two ranges of blood tests or alternatively a painless plug style biopsy which is very accurate for diagnosis.     I was still positive for the virus after six months and still have shingles going into my eight month.     It is disappointing to find the lack of articles explaining that the shingles virus can last much longer than the 4-6 weeks, as most articles read, for those of us in that agonizing position, they don’t even allude to the possibility.    Acyclovir 800 mg five time per day does work to reduce the rash but not the swelling. When I stop taking the Acyclovir, it returns in a week or two. Overall Acyclovir is well worth it, to help reduce the redness and itching but not so much the pain and swelling. You can slowly reduce the medication to 3 per day, after you are under some control.     There is also an Acyclovir ointment, a little expensive not sure it helps as much, one or two times per day.     To be clear Acyclovir does significantly help with few limited side effects, the occasional headache, ringing in the ears, blurred vision.  Read More Read Less",
413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,R. Mundo ,55-64 ,Male ,On medication for 6 months to less than 1 year ,Patient,Shingles ,4.3,"I had a nine level spine fusion T10-S2. All 18 screws and two 12"" rods had to be removed months later, with screws abutting my spinal cord. I was left with no fusion and no hardware to prevent movement at L5-S1, which is unbearable. A few weeks later I got shingles on the left side adjacent to the bottom half of one of the long incisions. I began with Valacyclovir 500 mg 3 X per day. I went through five bottles over five months. The doctor put me on Acyclovir 800 mg five per day. I have taken that for the last 2.5. months. It takes the redness down some until I stop and then the shingles returns as if nothing was done. I am now taking four-800mg per day to help, but my side remains very swollen and the pain on top of a spine with no bone union is beyond unbearable. So anyone that is wondering if you can have shingles for months on end, the answer is yes. I am entering the eight month and cannot have my spine surgery hardware put back in until it is gone completely, something that will be very unpleasant in itself. Acyclovir does work, as a maintenance drug to tamp it down, I do recommend it, but it will not kill it, just help. To be clear it is worth taking.

When I reacted, they shrugged and changed me over to Augmentin, which worked fine with NO side effects.  If that was an option, there's NO REASON I should ever have been prescribed this poison. It's black boxed in the US, Health Canada has strong warnings for it, you're only supposed to be given it in extremely dire situations... and I knew NONE of this until it was too late.Read More Read Less",

I came off of it for a little over a year in 2015/2016, and started losing weight, which I needed to do. I had to go back on it in 2017 and have gained almost 20 lbs. since. When I went back on it in 2017, my doctor had me up to 3200mg per day. That was such a high dosage that it suppressed all the nerve feeling in me that (I’m so embarrassed) I started wetting the bed occasionally. I asked my doctor about it and she said it was not the medication. I didn’t agree with her, so I reduced my dosage to 900mg per day and the bed wetting never happened again. It definitely helps my nerve pain, but it causes me to be in a brain fog, have memory issues and I’m sure it’s the reason for my weight gain. I only take it when my nerve pain flares up, and once it settles, I come off of it immediately.

Docs use it off-label, however, to treat other issues such as nerve pain - which is how I came to use it.  Yes, it worked in taking nerve pain away initially -- but only by practically knocking me out.  I prompted reduced the dose by 50% & was only taking 150mg - but the side effects were ultimately too troubling for me to continue & I took myself off the drug after 3 months.  The worst of those side effects were:  1) makes you loopy, unable to organize, unable to organize thoughts & express yourself normally; makes you seem really stupid  2) joint pain — even after discontinuing the drug.  I experienced joint pain in 2 extremities that was so significant I had to have cortisone injections.  I don’t have arthritis.  But now — I have this side effect to contend with.  Will the cortisone knock out the pain forever?  Probably not.    After my experience, I met a young woman who had been prescribed by her neurologist 1200 mg/day to manage her migraines.  At that dosage — I’m surprised she was even awake.  She was overweight & lethargic & had no idea that the drug might be causing her these side effects.  I also recall that my own father had been prescribed this drug.  Upon reflection, that was likely inappropriate.  He had some short term memory loss, but was not diagnosed by his docs as Alzheimers.  But this drug can certainly make a person seem demented - even when they are not.  So — beware.  Being mislabeled medically can have serious consequences.  In the wrong hands, medical misinformation can be used to challenge a patient’s competence &  result in a patient losing rights.   Think long & hard before you take this drug.Read More Read Less",

462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Marie ,45-54 ,Female ,On medication for less than 1 month ,Patient,Other ,1.0,"I was prescribed this for chronic migraines. I'd been taking a combination  of acetaminophen/ibuprofen  3-4 times daily. My neurologist told me I was experiencing ""rebound headaches"" from taking so much medicine. He told me to immediately stop taking them, although he didn't suggest anything else to help me that I could afford.(Newer migraine meds such as Nurtec and Ubrelvy, aren't  covered by Medicare, and would cost me $800-900/month out-of-pocket.) 
I started with 10mg daily and worked up to 30mg by week three. During that time, I sat in a dark room during the day; was in too much pain to sleep well at night; and literally did nothing but the basics due to debilitating pain. 
I eventually started to experience less pain, which I attribute to stopping the OTC meds that were causing the rebound headaches.
After another month of being on the nortriptyline I decided that the side effects were worse than - or at least as bad as - the headaches.
I was so tired during the day, I could barely motivate myself to do anything. I experienced muscle weakness to the point where I could no longer perform simple tasks like carrying a laundry basket or a gallon of milk. The dry mouth was so intense, I'd wake up during the night unable to swallow; my tongue felt like it was coated with lint; my breath was horrendous; and my sense of taste was off.in addition, I started craving sugar. It got so bad that I couldn't control it and ended up eating cookies, candy and pastry throughout the day  As a result, I gained 13 lbs. in 10 weeks; and my glucose went from 91 to 128. Then there was the constipation, another horror story. 
As of this writing, the migraines are only sporadic, and less severe than they used to be. If I feel a headache coming on, I take an OTC sinus and congestion medicine and it goes away completely, something I wasn't  able to achieve with my other OTC combination. And I haven't  had to take them more than once a day if I need them at all.
I've only been weaned off nortryptiline for a couple of days, and I'm feeling much better. Soon after cutting back on my dosage, the tiredness, muscle weakness and sugar cravings are significantly diminished.Read More Read Less",

It was prescribed to me after trying 3 other antidepressants (paxil, terazodone and mirtazapine) that didn't work for me horrible experiences. I litterally felt like i was losing my mind. I had to stop the mirtazapine cold turkey last Sunday. I started with 10mg of nortriptyline which I finally slept intermittently but slept. But i don't know if it was because i didnt sleep the night before and that's why it worked a little bit.  I thought it would provide more of sedating effect but it didn't which my doctor had mentioned that to me. She  prescribed it for anxiety and insomnia due to my symptoms lingering after getting the COVID variant on 7/24 took paxlovid and rebounded the following week after taking that drug. I have lost 18 plus pounds since getting the virus and still suffering from loss of appetite. Dont get me wrong i could of stood to loose some weight, but not like this. I have been out of work since August 15th and now on FMLA. I hate taking western medicine and still confused on why my doctor put me on this. Because I read its primarily used more for nerve pain. I told her I didn't want to be on anymore antidepressants but she said it wasn't considered a antidepressant only at the higher doses. I upped the dose to 20mg last night and hoped I would get the sedating effect and sleep, but it didnt. I had to end up taking 10ml of liquid benadryl 4 hours later to help me get some sleep. I may have slept 2 or 3 hours and now I'm awake with dry mouth and feeling nauseous and tired. My doctor said I can gradually up my dose up to 50mg. I hope that won't be the case for me because  I have a low tolerance for medication. I am going to try 30mg tonight in hopes that it will finally work for sleep. But then again it may work because of me not sleeping last night. I have got to get back to work and start feeling like myself again. I would like to see more positive reviews about this drug. But I keep reading bad ones and getting discouraged. But like people have said on here that this medication may not be for everyone. Because at this point I am starting to lose hope that this will not work for what it was prescribed for. So please someone out there, let me know that there is hope on the horizon. And that I will start to see the  light at the end of tunnel. And be able get off this medication roller coaster that I have been on for 2 months now.Read More Read Less",

I had an accident that caused nerve damage to my neck and was in a lot of pain that otc meds or gabapenten wouldn’t help. 
My dr started me on nortriptoline and within 3 days I had pain relief. Mood was still the same. But after 3 weeks on nortriptoline my depression and pain was completely gone! I was sleeping like a baby, I woke up ready for the day, joined a gym, I was happy, pain free, had energy. It was truly a God send. 
My only side effects was weight gain and constipation. After 2 years on it I decided to quit taking it because despite exercise and eating healthy, I couldn’t lose a pound. I only had bowel movements once a week. 
I didn’t have any side effects coming off of the medication. I tapered myself. 

I’ve been off of nortriptoline for over a year now. My pain is manageable. I’ve lost the weight I gained. But the depression is kicking my butt despite trying all sorts of natural antidepressants (SAM-e, St. John’s wort, etc) 
So I’m actually thinking of going back on nortriptoline. I’ve never felt as good as I did on it. Its almost worth the weight gain to be happy, have energy and sleep normal. 

Anyone who’s scared to try nortriptoline, don’t let some of the reviews scare you. It may not work for everyone, but for some people it’s a miracle! Read More Read Less",

Level dropped to 5.4. Noticed that my hands skin is drier.  After 4 months, I started getting bad pain in hips, lower back and thighs after I got omnicron COVID. Pains and fatigue finally going away after 8 weeks so probably not this drug. Do drink at least 40 oz of water minimum every day. Changed my diet to avoid purines, especially meat. Lost 17 pounds!  Also I put heat on big toe to speed up dissolving crystals. Big toe joint was last area to go back to normal in 3 minths. This medicine stopped the joint pains and got me back on my feet. No other problems until I got COVID but it's resolving now. I take it everyday after lunch. Some asthmatic coughing noted but could be other triggers.

The problem is that most Dr.s do not well understand gout or allopurinol and therefore start patients on dose that is to low to be effective. And, do not start allopurinol in the midst of a gout attack. Doing this just makes it worst. I have been there. The dose required for most people is 200 mg minimum.  I take 300 because I am a large man. Over a 20 year experience on this dose I have not had a single gout attack.  Caution, if you are taking other meds like Bilinta or Plavix, they will increase uric acid production.

I was recently diagnosed w/hypothyroidism [Hashimoto/autoimmune]; ok great; atleast I got an answer now let's fix me bc I don't like what's going on w me. My psychiatrist did my bloodwork 3wks after my PCP; fasting both times; my levels different PCP normal range prior to 6m ago they were low & Psych BW were extremely low, along w/ vitamin D & B critically low. Clearly roller coaster. [Yes psych did refer me to Endo; I haven't gone yet]. Resulting in a TON of scripts written; the main one Levothyroxine 25mg generic for Synthroid.  Didn't do alot of research bc I didn't want to scare myself.  Well damage done; buy also to know I am not alone makes me feel so less crazy then what I thought I was bc NOONE BELIEVES ME. I have been on for only 3mns; was told that I have to allow it time to work w my body. I did a DNA swab test to see how my body would handle/react to meditations as well. This med came up in the good list. I am STILL so flipping tired; exhausted, fatigue is drives me nuts.  I have no NRG at all. Even crazier is I can't sleep. I am still tired while awake and WIDE awake when I am supposed to sleeping OR I will sleep, absolutely lazy for days in a row; making a cup of coffee is the most taunting exhausting task but achieved. At first when I started day 1 (Yes I take as prescribed) I felt a boost of NRG.woke up happy & ready to go; that honestly lasted 10m no lie. I was, am so bummed out. I felt like I was losing weight at first but NOPE I am gaining now. I am so depressed. My face today looks like a 13yo but not 3mths ago.  I am so irritated and moody just thinking about it makes me cry; Inpatient, sweating for NO FLIPPIN REASON and it's not attractive it's disgusting.  My skin is SO dry & itchy I can't put enough moisturizer on my body nor in my HAIR. OMG it's like a bale of HAY & I cut it bc it was so dry & on my nerves having a bad day; and those are fighting words in my world. My anxiety is through the roof along w my BP. I now take SIX 6 medications EVERY DAY. My entire hurts; painfully hurts. 
Anyways moral of my comment and after reading y'alls guess who isn't taking this medication trwm? This girl. I am finding something else. I literally feel like death & completely empty I don't know how that one lady said her libido went up but good for her I wish; bc I don't even think about it anymore I am 45yo. It should be an extra curriculum activity right now.  But no it's not. Well my brain fog & tiredness is kicking in; this comment was my 1 thing to do today now I will sit on couch and DO NOTHING.  Can't wait to get this out of my system bc I need to go to the bathroom.  Oh and forgot to mention I had to get glasses bc my vision is so blurry. DO BETTER BIG PHARMA!!  Read More Read Less",

I was told there is no treatment for hashimoto's, only supplementing with thyroid. My dose began at 75 mcg. Over a few years, my dose has been steadily increased now to 175 mcg. I am concerned that my doctor cares nothing for my thyroid gland withering away. He doesn't believe there is anything under the sun that can reverse the disease. He doesn't believe gluten is relevant, he recommendes no vitamin/mineral supplements, no dietary recommendations.

I do sometimes feel rapid heartbeat, my sleep isn't ideal, my energy levels aren't great. When I tell my symptoms to the doctor, he's not interested. But while the symptoms aren't serious, they're there. And he refuses to check my reverse T3, which I've also read can be relevant. Some patients are given T3 supplement in addition to, or as a total replacement, for the T4 (levothyroxine).

I was told the generic version contains fillers, including gluten, which is ironic since many say gluten should be avoided entirely for hashimoto's patients.Read More Read Less",

I knew something was wrong... I was so bloated, everything swollen all the time, depressed, tired and gradually gaining weight while eating extremely clean and working out 6 days a week. I went from being a college athlete at 155 pounds to 190 pounds in 3 years. No matter what I did, I woke up so tired and SO bloated. I finally went to an endocrinologist a week 1/2 ago and she prescribed me 25 mcg levythyroxine with a TSH at 6.4. I have taken it for 5 days and weighed myself this morning and I weighed 178 pounds. I dropped 12 pounds in 5 days on this medication. It's literally falling off and I feel like an entirely new person. I have energy, I can see my chin and my pants fit. I truly forgot what it felt like to feel normal. I just assumed that I was getting older and my body was changing. I literally cannot wait to wake up and take this medication again. I can't wait to see how I feel in even a week or a month. If you too a struggling, find and endocrinologist that can truly help you because my life has changed. Read More Read Less",

I had been prescribed this medicine before Thanksgiving, but on Jan 1, I decided to make my resolution to take this like I had been prescribed. I had been taking it for 2 mos, but saw no improvement with my condition. About a week ago ,I had started having feeling like I was suffocating, chest pressure, trouble swallowing, could only sleep for about 3 hours a night, high anxiety, no appetite, high blood pressure, crabby, and just plain feeling sick. I had tried to get my Dr. To prescribe an anti anxiety pill, I was feeling so depressed. If this med was to supposed to help me in the long run, it sure feel short. I have been off it for 2 days now, but still am having breathing trouble.

As a child it was really hard taking the medication but my mom was very consistent in making sure I was on the right track. I don’t recall feeling any different then if I was off it. As I got older that dose was not working anymore and my period was all crazy. I got a new prescription of 100mcg and just this year it stopped working for me and it resulted to Hashimoto Thyroiditis. My new dose is 125mcg and it definitely hasn’t been working for me. I haven’t got my period in over 3 months, I’ve been having muscle ache and weakness, I get extremely tired ( im only 20), I’ve been having mood swings, been constipated, and the list goes on.

I began seeing only the PCP there, and over a period of about 18 months my TSH numbers were a roller coaster. I finally decided to clean my system out and only take the generic which is less potent and I am on the lowest dose available. At one point I again became very anxious for no obvious reasons and turned out I was hypothyroid again so I had to increase my dosage slightly. My thyroid has been OK for the last year in normal range I just retired and continue to work out 3 to 5 times a week religiously, incl pilates, cardio and strength training. Over the past year I have gained approximately 15 pounds and regardless of food intake do not lose weight?! In addition I have a gun sweating profusely intermittently as if I’m going through menopause hot flashes recently So when I work out I sweat twice as much. My hydration is fine I drink sufficient amount of water and other non-alcoholic beverages to keep myself hydrated. The fact of the matter is that we are putting drugs into our system and I guess just have to accept that this is how it’s going to be.When I asked PCP that I take the more natural route, she explained there “really was no natural remedy for hypothyroidism, that the Armour Thyroid was certainly not natural!” I’m working with my acupuncturist to see if he can help this situation.Read More Read Less",

I had my last child in 2019 (37 and I am now 39) and I have had all the symptoms of hypothyroidism since. My levels were fine but due to having all the symptoms my endo decided to put me Levothyroxine 25mg. I was so nervous due to reading all the reviews on all the sites. First day - I felt it immediately! A surge of energy. It blew my mind honestly. I couldn't believe how much energy I had. Then I was afraid it would go away lol. I did experience diarrhea as well. Just about every time I ate something but it wasn't nothing to really complain too much about, except that there was No holding it - whatsoever. That did dissipate after 2 weeks. As far as sleep - I still don't sleep deeply. I felt as if I hardly slept at all the first 2 weeks. I take melatonin though so at least I was able to get to sleep lol. I gained 5lbs in the first week of using Levothyroxine. I'm waiting to see if the weight comes off or if gaining will be my curse lol. I'm also waiting to see of I lose my hair. One person commented that taking Levo is much like taking a Hydrocodone lol and I believe the energy feeling is why they said that. I agree. The energy is nice. I wonder if this is how I'm supposed to feel normally?! It also has increased my libido. Sex has been better as in that I am more aroused and made climax easier. Bonus. This is my 3rd week and the only difference I notice is it is harder to get up in the morning. I don't wake with all the energy as though I never even slept as I did the first 2 weeks and my mood swings. One minute I am watching t.v. and fine and the next I am sad or mad. I don't like that. I hope it goes away and I pray I don't get any heavier and lose my hair. I am hoping I am a success story because I do like the way it gives me energy again. Which is the whole reason we started me on it. I hope I was detailed enough. I read hundreds of reviews looking for the best detailsRead More Read Less",

I sought professional help. I was prescribed Lexapro. Knowing its potential side effects include insomnia, agitation and increased irritability (that is, the EXACT ISSUES I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH in the first place!), I was reluctant to take it. I started with a 5 mg dosage. No improvements (in fact, my sleep kinda worsened, due to occasional nightmares). A week later, I was supposed to raise the dosage to 10 mg. It was then that I started to hate Lexapro. With 10 mg of Lexapro a day, I started getting even less sleep than before and feeling angrier than ever. Wow, that's definitely a way to help a person struggling with sleep and anger issues! Way to go, doc! 
I quitted it. But I'm not surprised it didn't help me. Because I wasn't even feeling depressed. If anything, I was closer to a manic state rather than to a depressed one.
The bottom line is, it's not a sleeping pill and it's not a tranquilizer either.Read More Read Less",

Don't kid yourself- the pill is not 'doing it FOR you' - it just helps by not being hungry and still being able to work and focus while not eating. Side effects - yes, but let's not kid ourselves - there are far more side effects from being heavy. So as long as  you go by the rules and eat less, healthy and also exercise and drink tons of water - as long as you do that the pill is PERFECT.

The insomnia only lasted 2 days. The feelings of irritability or anger were only for a few days. No jitters or anxiety. And I’m sensitive to caffeine. But there are other side effects that continue that you should prepare for to have a good experience. Firstly, drink water. Spring water or coconut water because you need to replenish electrolytes. For some people regular water will not cut it. 
Another thing, I got sever dry mouth. My mouth was getting bad until I ordered dry mouth lozenges and after 3 days of those the moisture level returned. Also, this medication gave me a hemorrhoid. Very bad. Prep h didn’t work. What worked for that was using dude wipes and buying standard process collinsonia root. Gone. 
I worked out while on the drug and had great results, at first. Unfortunately for me the drug stopped working after 2.5 weeks which was a bummer.

It is now Feb 9th 2023. I went from 204 lbs, to 174 lbs in two months, 30 lbs lost. It is most definitely effective. However, the drug itself does not make you lose weight. It is an appetite suppressant. In order to lose weight you have to drastically reduce your calorie intake. Phentermine allowed me to consume less than 1000 calories a day, and not be insane with hunger. I have 9 lbs more to lose in order to reach my goal weight of 165 lbs. I started taking phentermine on a Thursday, big mistake. Thursday night I was completely unable to sleep. When you first start taking it there are side effects. For me they lasted about a week and were a bit extreme. I would suggest you start taking it on a day, where you have the next day or two off. The inability to sleep was extreme for a few days. After that it continued to lessen. To the point I was more than able to sleep 8+ hrs a night. Other side effects were ringing in my ears, and constipation. The drug is extremely effective, but it is more than possible to binge eat on it if you are determined. It does make small meals make you feel quite full though.

After that the positive effects seemed to diminish. I took the pills for 60 days then was off for 30.  Then back on for another 60 days. In the first round paired with Minimal exercise (Walking several times a week) I was successful in loosing some weight but the results were not drastic. It does take a lot of self control after you stop taking the medication so as not to gain everything back. I was less successful at that.  The 2nd round was paired with a more intense Daily exercise routine (Low Impact Aerobic). Much better success on the 2nd round.

582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pat ,65-74 ,Female ,On medication for 1 to 6 months ,Patient,Other ,1.0,"I was prescribed this medication for two different reasons. Primarily it was prescribed to help prevent migraines, which it does a great job at. Secondly, for insomnia, which is a bit iffy, but not horrible. I’ve been on this medication for a few months now and I have many notes.

1. Every morning I wake up with dry eyes, dry mouth. Dry mouth leads to my throat becoming sore because I talk constantly at work. 

2. As another person mentioned, I am incredibly irritable. I am usually a cheerful woman, but as of late, I get irritable with everyone very quickly and over silly things. 

3. This medication has caused me to have tachycardia. Last night I took a trip to urgent care (for unrelated issues) but they were more concerned with my BPM which was averaging 135-142 while resting. I was not nervous, just didn’t feel well. I have made notes to my significant other many times about my heart rate seeming abnormally high for no reason. Doing very mundane tasks causes my heart rate to soar. It usually feels like I can’t satisfyingly breath. 

Overall, this medication works for my migraines, but when it comes to side effects like tachycardia (which can put a lot of stress on your heart if it goes on for an extended period of time) it’s not worth it in my opinion. Not every person who takes Amitriptyline will experience tachycardia, but please be aware that it CAN happen. If you already have underlying health issues with your heart, this can be incredibly dangerous. Read More Read Less",

The first day of taking it after a break is always a bit uncomfortable (I get nausea) but it gets better soon if you take it every day. My advice is to eat a big breakfast before you take it and not miss any doses if you can avoid it - if you take it on and off you may have trouble eating. Overall, it's a huge help, especially for students like myself. I remember reading reviews right after I got my diagnosis as an adult, so if that's your situation, try it!

A few weeks later I start having little twitches, nothing too serious but still concerning to me as I have never really twitched before. Another week goes by and the twitches get worse, my eyes roll back, my neck gets locked into one position, etc. After two months of this worsening to the point of testing to rule out seizures, I get told that I developed a motor/vocal tic disorder as a side effect of Concerta. I was immediately taken off the medication but the tics never stopped. I've been off of Concerta for a year and a half now and learning to cope with my tics and how they will permanently impact my life. It had no impact on my ADHD symptoms either.

It was used for school but in the state I am right now (puberty) I really don't care about anything and leave school work undone and when I actually try i give up. Virtual school is the hardest time which I'm doing at the moment but even face to face school still was bad. There is 0 purpose at the moment for me to even take it since I'm calm on and off the pills. Advice from me (could be absolutely wrong) maybe not take these when you are going through puberty. I have built multiple addictions, isolation from COVID and starting to think I build up depression right at this moment nothing is helping me. I don't know if the mental state I am is from the pills or maybe a mix of isolation and pills but I know for a fact it's not helping me. I feel drowsy always headaches no appetite and I feel like s***. To sum up the rambling I made don't use these when going through puberty and maybe actually see if the pills are doing you good or not. I am currently thinking about going on a new medication or not even having meds and getting a therapist ad well as more of a social life due to me only knowing people my age from school which I do online. If I do quit the meds I will definitely try to improve my life so as therapy and have care from my family if worse depression or suicidal thoughts occur.

When I forget to take it I feel nervous and jittery, I don't feel addicted to it, and when I do remember to take it it works for the first few hours but it wares off around 1-3pm and leaves me feeling nervous and jittery. It has messed me up so bad. Before I was on it I didn't have to remind myself to smile everyday. I'm so messed up that I've starting self harming. Before I was on this med I was happy and didn't have a care in the world about anything it was great. But being on it now has honestly just screwed me up so much. Please don't put your children on this! It's not worth it in the long run, trust me. And if you are having the same troubles as me please speak up to your parents and doctor.Read More Read Less",

I thought that it would likely take some time to actually kick in, but going on three months and I haven't felt or seen an improvement.  I do have a distaste for food now, I never ""want"" to eat in the sense that I've lost cravings for food; but then this was already starting to occur slightly before I started this medication.

615,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anonymous,,,,Patient,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity ,3.3,"I had been taking this stuff since I was 9. Doc said 72 mg should be good for 100 pound 9 year old(45kg). And I stayed on 72 mg until I was a  sophomore in highschool. Mom never asked me how I felt though. She was just proud I was an all A student. My Dad asked though, amd I told him that it felt like I was dead or dying. I felt achey all the time, cotton mouth, sweating while I’m wearing shorts and a T-shirt in a freezing classroom, always agitated, always had a headache, and I always had a stomach ache but trying to eat would make me throw up if I ate the normal amount. But that went away after two years. I had finally gotten used to just feeling like death. I didn’t realize how bad it was until I started it up again in College. Its my junior year and I can’t afford to mess it up so I started taking it again my sophomore year. And I honestly felt worse than I have felt when I’m hungover, but hey my grades rose up. Looking back I’d of rather taken the Cs and had more friends. Because if anyone interrupts you while you are doing your work. It’s Game Over.

I went off the pills for a few months after taking them for over 10 years. I didn't know it wasn't normal to hate how food tastes, constantly feel sweaty, have a dry mouth, and feel absolutely terrible, among other things. I went back on them recently for school, and I hate it. I am getting better grades now, but for dinner tonight I ate only a quarter of an apple and I think I am getting underweight again. Food tastes terrible. I feel terrible. The anxiety and other side effects this gives me make me want to self harm. I am extremely sleep deprived, as I have not slept anywhere near enough since I restarted the medicine. It was ok as a kid because I had been taking it for so long that I had forgotten life wasn't supposed to be like this. But after taking a break, I hate feeling like this. But if I don't take it, I will do badly at uni, so I am ignoring this horribleness. I can't enjoy being alive. I just want to be able to stop taking this medicine without failing uni.  Other than that, the medicine works well. It is easy to use, improves my focus, and makes me less hyper.  And to the parents I see leaving reviews here, obviously your grade school children can not leave reviews online, but please do ask them how they are feeling, you may find that have a different perspective on the medicine than you do because you are not experiencing the side effects personally. My parents understand the side effects, but they do not understand how terrible it truly is. My doctor has said that I am unusually sensitive to the side effects, but I am not the only one who feels like this, I have seen, on reddit, plenty of people who also feel terrible with the medicineRead More Read Less",

If you aren't a person with ADHD or ADD that has been on this drug, please don't say how it works to others. Check in with the people on concerta. Though I respect the intention behind the reviews, let the kids speak for themselves. Ask if they're struggling with anything and how you can SUPPORT them.

I have also suffered from all of the things that everyone else mentioned. Someone also said that you don't notice them right away. And that's true, I had been taking it for for at least a year while having severe muscle pain and just a host of other issues thinking they were being brought on because of getting older. It wasn't until about a month ago that my friend told me to read the side effects that I realized it was the Atorvistatin that was causing all those issues! I  immediately stopped taking it and called the pharmacy and was told not to stop it unless I check with my doctor. I  told them that I would rather take my chances of having a heart attack than to suffer from these debilitating side effects! Since I stopped taking it I am starting to feel a little relief, but I'm still having major problems. I just hope I haven't suffered irreversible damage to my body because of it. I will never take that stuff again! I also hope others who have experienced adverse effects from it will get some relief as well.

My primary doctor told me that I have mild arteriosclerosis but did not prescribe any medicine, just to follow a low-fat diet.                                                  
   After that visit, I started to experience irregular heartbeats/palpitations, went to the cardiologist and he said that those heartbeats were ''kind of normal''and not to worry.  He saw that I have the mild arteriosclerosis and told me that 'If he were me, he would start taking a low dose of Lipitor', so he prescribe me a 10mg pill.

My doctor had put me on lipitor as a very young age when I was in 2nd grade. Lipitor wasn’t helping me so my doctor would give me stronger medication after stronger medication and that medication ruined my life and still at these 19 years of age I struggle with the side affects due to me taking them for so long. These pills would make me trip and fall. It would give me trouble walking, running, going up the stairs, down the stairs, trouble concentrating, pain on my nerves, weak muscles, collapsing, foggy memory, forgetting to breathe, tired, weak,etc. I stopped taking the medication when I collapsed due to my body giving up on me during p.e, I’ve developed scars on my arms and legs due to all the falling it was causing me. When I stopped taking it, I was in high school and then I thought I was going to be better but then when I stopped I developed anxiety, depression, adhd, clumsiness, i still have a foggy memory, over sleep, under sleep,etc. Though now that I suffer with those things I blame the medication, it ruined my life as a kid, a teenager, and adult. Although that’s how my life is going to be I want to share with you all what I take instead of medication, my mom was doing research of what she can give me to help my cholesterol and she found “ kyolic garlic cardiovascular formula 100” I started taking it after I stopped taking lipitor and those natural herb pills help lower my cholesterol, no it doesn’t help me with my anxiety or my depression or my clumsiness but it helps with anything that has to do with your cardio vascular. It helps regulate your blood pressure and it does not just help lower cholesterol but it helps with other things. I really do recommend “kyolic garlic cardiovascular formula 100” there are many good reviews on it about it helping it lower your cholesterol and I hope you all try it, ik it says it has no odder but it does, it just makes you burp and u can smell ur garlic breath but to prevent it I recommend taking it with your food so that won’t happen.

I feel the threat now that I've experienced some of what others have described. I just found Lichen Planus inside my cheek and learned that some people even get that. I'm getting to the point that if a new malady arises I'll blame it on the statin. We're all different and react differently to things (take the peanut for example - they'll kill some of you but I love them).

I stopped taking the drug because of the cost of am eye exam and office visits and lack of insurance. I am not in a flair.

Head CT that was clear. Labs were clear. They gave me muscle relaxers and told me I was stressed out. Went to my doctor a week later and she gave me high blood pressure pills which killed me. The only thing different in my life in the past 10 years was that I started taking Crestor. It never occurred to me this could be the cause until I started reading hundreds of comments and forums. I have had a headache for 6 weeks, vertigo and dizziness every single day for a month, terrible anxiety, leg tingling and disorientation. I decided to stop the Crestor and see what happens. I didn't have that high of a reading when it came to the cholesterol, so the whole thing was not worth it. Very very upsetting to me.

A few weeks later, began Zyrtec for seasonal allergy.  Within days, bad headaches no amount of Tylenol I dared take could control.  So stopped both for a couple months; then resumed Crestor alone at 5 mg.  Blood tests at 6 months were excellent; total cholesterol dropped from low 300s to very low 200s, maybe even 195, can't find the results at this moment.  Improvement on HDL and LDL.  So everything seemed great at 6, 7 months.  Then I started developing little issues that seemed odd.  MD wanted me to increase dosage slightly, go to 10mg twice a week, 5mg the other days.  Then I started developing little odd issues.  Some lengthy periods of diarrhea -- a week, once, whereas it was never more than a day previously unless I had a serious illness (which I rarely get).  A trace of headache some nights.  Noticed I was weaker; could barely get a 16-lb bag of charcoal out the door, unusual.  Bad pain in my lower back and some in one shoulder.  My light sleeping turned into serious insomnia, waking at 1 or 2 a.m. and being wide awake for hours.  And I had become more anxious, until I was anxious all the time, like ""free-floating anxiety.""  So I am stopping the dosage increase and I am reducing it instead to see if there is improvement.  Splitting the 5mgs in two so I will be taking 2.5 mg and only every other day.  A minimal kind of maintenance dose while I hope for improvement in the physical and mental areas.  Every one of my issues could have some other explanation, but taken together, they seem too much to be coincidental.  I suspect bad side effects from the Crestor.Read More Read Less",

I was on it a month...and that is all it took for me to have all kinds of serious side effects, that to this day...I am still getting.  I now, suffer from panic attacks...on it...I had severe muscle and joint pain...which I already have, but this made it a 1000 times worse!  As soon as I started on this, I noticed the increase of headaches...depending on what I would do throughout the day, they would kick into a migraine...even my emergency migraine medication would not work for them. I felt like I was going to vomit, every day...and I could not sleep on this.  I regularly get 5 hours of sleep a night, which I am okay with, I can function on that...but on Crestor...maybe a hour...if that.  I took myself off of this toxic crap...and then the panic attacks and severe stomach pain started.  I have noticed the stomach pain ceasing, but these panic attacks are in full swing.  They come out of the blue and my first one warranted a trip to the emergency room, by ambulance, because my blood pressure sky rocketed to 210/119, I thought for sure I was having a heart attack.  So, now...with all the other Rx's I regularly take for my other issues, I have been prescribed 2 different anxiety meds, prozac and hydroxyzine...and was told to take both of them together.  So, now, I don't feel like I am safe with driving my car.  I will NEVER again take a statin.  And to think I TRUSTED my doctor, who already knows I suffer on a daily basis...and then act like she doesn't know what is going on.  I am really hoping these panic attacks end...they are ruining my life.  Make sure you ASK your Dr for ALL the side effects BEFORE agreeing to take this.

I have informed my doctor and he told me to take them at night instead of during the day.  Not sure why that will change my pain, but I am working with him to figure this out.

My History (If you care):
I am a super fit and mostly healthy person.  I work out constantly, eat right, etc, etc.  Within a few weeks of taking these I felt the pain in my knuckles, then it progressed to my whole hand, within another week, my hip started aching as well as my lower back.  I really started to feel like an old man and act like one within weeks of taking this pill.  I told the doctor that I will no longer take these pills if they are going to do this to me.  They have almost completely shut down my daily routines of being active.  My Dr said my alternative was that I would die, but I say, what good is life if at 50, I have to quit all the activities that make me fit and happy, just so my numbers meet your current standards?  He told me that will all of the exercise that I do, that it will be nearly impossible to regulate my pills along with BP meds.  This seems very conflicting to me, so if I sit on the couch and do nothing, he can regulate my everything with meds, but if I exercise daily and eat right, not possible.  I laughed when he told me this.  It would appear that the current medical field has no idea how to deal with people who try to stay fit and have issues that may require these pills.  Just like with anything in life, there are always edge cases, it would seem that the Pharma and medical industries do not test edge cases or care.  They do know about the side affects, they just state that they only happen in less than 1%, which I find hard to believe.  So now I am being asked stupid questions like do I drink city water, and do I eat foods at restaurants. If this pill is so picky that I can't drink city water or go out to eat once a week anymore...then I give up...Read More Read Less",

Was taken to the ICU.  Trachea tube became dislodged.  Another cardiac arrest.  Long story short, because of how long it took staff to revive him, he has an anoxic brain injury.  Two years later, he’s stuck inside his body, in a nursing home.  He understands everything, but can’t move his body, talk, use his hands.  He is 58 years old, 55 when this happened.

I was placed on 10days of Clexane injections and then 150mg Pradaxa afterward. After the first week of Pradaxa I started having some serious chest pains that pierces all the way to my back, even though I've been watching what I eat to limit my vitamin k intake. It makes me jittery, my heart races hard for short moments at that time my tongue feels like I've been plugged into a power socket. Shortness of breath at this point too. Leaves a weird taste in my mouth. currently trying to get this medication changed. I cant manage this much longer. It scares me,  my family, and my coworkers a lot whenever I have an attack.

I am extremely tired and my skin is incredibly dry. The bloated belly is not my idea of fun- that comes with all of the anticoagulants. The one positive aspect of this drug is that the lovenox was costing me $300.00 month after insurance paid and pradaxa costs me $51.21 month after insurance.  My hair stopped falling out since stopping the lovenox but I have also started to break out in acne.  I have been suffering from terrible mood swings from rage to extreme depression. My allergies have intensified greatly since starting pradaxa.  I do know for a fact that pradaxa is causing the new side effects because I quit taking all anticoagulants for three weeks in December 2015 and all of the side effects disappeared.

Ask doctor first but for me! :

Start for about 10-14 days on 25 mg!! Then cut the pill in equal halves! If stay on 25 mg or higher will have drastically low blood pressure magnifying problems you taking this medicine for!! It is FAST ACTING. Take on time … 22-23 hours later you start to feel it weaning off. Do not forget to take this medicine.

DO NOT forget to take this medicine!! You can pass out or get a heart attack. 

It is something you can get chemically addicted to but will take LONG time for dependence even in prone people. 

You can eventually cut pill into 1/3 or even 1/4 for weeks or indefinitely to WEAN OFF.

WEAN OFF -DO NOT FORGET DAILY DOSE OR RISK HEART ATTACK.

I noticed they significantly reduce in swelling when they are wrapped or in a sneaker, which barely fits over my foot. Elevating and icing doesnt do much quick enough. The DR even said that this med usually isn't a first choice for a primary. One w/ a diuretic is standard, if your blood panel works within those parameters.

Beta blockers should be the second drug you take for hypertension.  First should be a thiazide diuretic because  it has fewer side effects.  These two drug classes are the only drugs for hypertension that by themselves reduce the risk of heart attack or death.   Together, they reduce the risk of death or heart attack more than either does alone.  Once you take minimal amounts of these two drugs, if more is needed, add an  ACE inhibitor which further reduces the risk of death/heart attack.  Caution:  alone, ACE inhibitor does not reduce the risk.  And then consider adding a fourth drug, a calcium channel blocker  which, in combination with the others,  adds further protection against death/heart attack.

Day 3 and everything went away and my lower back glut and legs were numb. No more shooting pain from hamstring down to my toes.

I have noticed constipation, but I have found that if I hydrate continually throughout the day and take fiber supplements that I am able to better counteract that side effect.

The second and third time I took prednisone was before and after my sinus surgery and that was to reduce swelling before and after surgery. My fourth time taking prednisone was because I’ve developed bronchitis after having a sinus infection and I was getting asthma and severe coughing  Every day multiple times a day and I was resorting to using my inhaler multiple times a day just to be able to breathe when I went to my doctor.

760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Michael Fash ,75 or over ,Male ,,Patient,Group of Skin Disorders that Resemble Blisters ,5.0,"I am writing on behalf of my Mom. Dx w RA at 34 yrs old. Allergic to all conventional treatment medications at that time so was put on long term low dose prednisone for over 40years.  Even when in later years when able to take biological was able to reduce prednisone somewhat but not off completely due to other complicating factors for the biological.  One side effect for long term usage is it thins the skin severely- like tissue paper. Also found out it does the same thing to the bowel walls.  She ended up with multiple bowel obstructions from the bowel contents leach8ng out through the bowel walls and her body trying to confine the infection by setting up a walled off abscess.  This would need to be surgically removed. She developed fistulas tracking trom her bowel to the skin surface and into her vagina. Ultimately, with so many bowel obstructions she ended up with an idle ostomy and had only 4 feet of good bowel remaining.  The last 10 years of her life were hell and hospital visits and stays.  Because she had hardly any bowel to digest her food, she was chronically undernourished, despite eating 6-8 times a day, and she was always hungry.  She was chronically dehydrated despite drinking constantly, and it never satiated her never ending thirst.  Once she ate or drank, the contents would shoot out of the ostomy undigested to the amount of 8-10 litres every day.  Because of the large output the ostomy bag came off repeatedly every day and night.  My parents were a slave to having to change the bag regardless off it being day or night!  Never mind preparing and feeding her and filling drinks.  Both of my parents were always optimistic and persevered with a smile always even though they were severely sleep deprived often.  So when you advocate for more doctors to prescribe long term prednisone usage instead of other available medications, like the expensive biologics, be careful what you wish for.  In addition to the thin skin and bowel walls, my beautiful mother developed a round swollen ‘moon’ face and the ‘buffalo’ hump on her upper back. Ant still with all those years on the prednisone she still ended up with knarled deformed fingers and still experienced osteoporosis arthritis.  Hurrah for the biologics!  I only wish they had been available for my Mom 30-40 years ago.  She passed from complications with the ostomy 6 months ago and I would do anything to have her been able to experienced a better quality of life than she did using prednisone for soooo long.Read More Read Less",

I go off and on since there is so much hype about side effects but I know some older docs who use to put patients on low low dose for years. If your over 65 and in severe pain and a low dose of this keeps you going what's the trade off? I think that since there is no money in it, research will never show its benefits. They want you to take the expensive Biologics instead. Like they dont have side effects? Have you listened to the commercials?

The fibre myalgia, on top of chronic depression nearly destroyed  my spirit.i gained weight, was sad all the time and I couldn't move like I used to cause it hurt so much. Cymbalta saved me, in the first week the pain was drastically reduced!  I did have minor side effects like loss of appetite and nausea but that only lasted for 2 and a half weeks. I did not affect my sleep except i could sleep without pai! I could go for 45 min walks agIn! I could do yoga, swim and dance with my little girl! I was so happy! My mood improved along with bieng able to be active again and I will continue taking this medication because it gave me back my life.
I understand some people feel that depression is a matter of changing the people your with, or how you live your life, or that society and "" big pharma"" make us sick..or that taking meds make you want to take more meds..the opposite is true..antidepressants aren't addictive..the biggest issue with depression is sufferers not staying g on the meds because of side effects. There are people where the wiring in thier brains does affect thier moods and behavior..no one wants to be depressed..or schizophrenic or bi polar..these medications save lives. I am grateful this helped me..I hope this helps you in your decision.Read More Read Less",

After a life-time of chronic pain (Fibro / Arthritis / Musculoskeletal pain ) that made me constantly exhausted and needing to bail out on activities I used to love - I feel practically “cured”!  I can stand up out of bed and actually start walking immediately (no more creaking and stretching and gingerly trying to move) and I can fall asleep without shooting pains and writhing around trying to change positions to ease aches. I still after 2 years on this drug, lie still in bed and marvel at feeling NO pain! 
I’m 57 Female on 60 mg 1 time a day. 
Usual early beginning side effects (queasiness and tired) lasted a couple weeks. Pain was gone within a week. One  day laying in bed reading - I had to put my book down and just marvel that I could feel zero pain. What an an incredible feeling after having chronic pain my whole life. 
Side effects are minimal for me: At first I was a bit tired, but without constantly fighting pain, I have SO much more energy!!! 
Don’t be afraid of all the negatives - many more people will hop on a review site to report negatives - There are so many of us out here who have literally been given our life back with this miracle drug!!! Read More Read Less",

After researching I found that this poison causes your GI tract to bleed, hence the blood. This stuff should be banned, as the long term side effects haven't even been fully investigated yet, and coming off it is as bad as heroin withdrawal. So to all those here who are saying to keep persevering with it I would just like to say.....Unless you are planning to take this rubbish for the rest of your life, good luck with the withdrawals when you finally try to come off it.

I wasn't sure if anxiety or tmj was causing my vertigo. My Dr said I was having panic attacks and we both agreed to try cymbalta for possible underlying anxiety. Wow. I am willing to try new things, but I've never been on a medication like this before, and I reacted horribly. I only took one 20mg dose. Within hours, I became cold, shivering, nausea, and extreme sweating. I also had to pee every 20 minutes. I actually became dehydrated after drinking 120oz of water. I felt high and jittery. My appetite was completely gone (I'd chew my food, with no will to swallow the food) and my taste buds changed. I stopped immediately. But it's now 2-3 days since my only dose and I'm still awful. It comes in waves I'm pretty much bed ridden. I'm jittery, nauseated, tense all over, feel like I got hit by a truck. I understand these medicines have side effects and you have to ""get used to it over time"" but I would consider this to be a very very extreme medication. There's no way I could continue this.

811,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,KCdoe ,55-64 ,Female ,On medication for 2 to less than 5 years ,Patient,Chronic Muscle or Bone Pain ,5.0,"I was prescribed Cymbalta (Dytrex equivalent) a couple of years ago for my Rheumatoid Arthritis ( in conjunction with another medication for my RA).  My Doctor said that Cymbalta is a very safe drug with very little side-effects; he didn’t mention anything about the withdrawal side-effects (I’m not sure if he really even knew the full extent of the withdrawal symptoms).  Now, in 2022, my Arthritis is under control so I am happy to gradually wean off the Cymbalta.  A couple of weeks into weaning off this medication, I was already going through hell, and I haven’t even taken it for a long period like some of the poor people who have commented in the last few years.  I suffered from constant diarrhoea, nausea, dizziness, brain-zaps, sleeping problems.  A few months further on into weaning off the Cymbalta, things were starting to get worse - I was getting constant ‘Hyperhidrosis’ (severe sweating of the heels, palms, underarms) - to the point that I was losing a lot of electrolytes in my body, and went to Emergency because I didn’t know what was wrong with me and why I wasn’t feeling better (I also had a viral cold at the same time, to complicate things more); I also realised that I was getting serious ‘Anxiety attacks’.  As a normal thing, I just get a ‘little’ bit of anxiety at times, but Cymbalta has made everything so bad!  I get anxiety attacks especially at night when I’m alone, I feel so scared to be alone by myself, I suddenly have an uncontrollable fear of death, fear of everything that threatens my safety and my life, I can’t even explain why I fear, I just feel that I fear, without even knowing what exactly it is that I fear,  things are just so literally crazy!  I don’t feel like I am myself, my head always feels so cloudy, unclear, fuzzy; I feel a deep sense of hopelessness, depression, lacking motivation in doing anything, even the things that I use to enjoy doing before;  I have memory loss, I use to be a very alert and switched-on type of person, now not anymore.  I feel my life has been ruined, and my good future has been prematurely taken away from me.  I don’t know if this anxiety attack will ever go away entirely, I don’t know if I will ever have a normal life like I did pre-Cymbalta.  I pray for all those who have and will suffer from this drug, and can only hope that eventually the withdrawal effects may miraculously taper off.  If I knew how bad the withdrawal side-effects were, I would ‘NEVER’ have taken Cymbalta, I would have tried some other drug for my RA.  The withdrawal symptoms are so bad that it’s not worth taking Cymbalta because in the process you will gain more serious problems, some of them may even last for a long time, whether they may be permanent, I do not know.  It is my hope, for the sake of us all, that they are not permanent withdrawal effects, such as my very scary and debilitating and paralysing ‘anxiety attacks’.  May we all help and support each other through this hellish journey.

After a couple of days I felt kind of numb all over, which was concerning even though the pain relief was welcome.  Then an increase in pain not only in ""the usual"" spots for me, but total body pain from head to toe.  Everything hurts.  And even though my doctor told me to continue the Cymbalta, that the ""side effects"" would lessen after 6 weeks, I couldn't stand the pain.  I completely stopped taking it a months ago and I am still experiencing all-over pain especially in mid and upper back, left hip, and ongoing headaches that I wasn't having before.

He advised I work up to one pill in the morning and one at night once my body adjusted to it. THE NEXT MORNING after my first pill, I woke up headache-free.

It was originally prescribed due to depression. Over that time period I also developed neuropathic pain in my face,  back, and arm (all one-sided). 
About 3 months ago, I decided to try tapering off Lyrica as I didn't feel it was treating my depression adequately anymore. Tapering down was HARD...I had to go by tiny increments over periods of weeks and months. I guess I wasn't too shocked because I had experienced terrible withdrawls from Cymbalta, and had taken it for a short period of time. When I got to 25 mg, I noticed a sharp increase in my nerve pain. I wasn't sure if it was coincidental or not (and probably nobody is because our bodies all work differently)....but I decided the strong correlation was worth me edging back up to see what happened. After two days back at 50 mg, there is some reduction of pain. So, maybe it wasn't the perfect script for me for depression (as it has been for others), but I am starting to think it was improving my neuro pain more than I even knew. Read More Read Less",

She was observed for well over two years before we were able to correlate the episodes with some of the side effects of her medication and since then she has had no issues. It was unfortunate because the Lyrica was the only medicine that helped with her severe fibromyalgia pain, she developed a dependency on it and it was difficult for her to come off of it but if she hadn't, neither I nor her loved ones know if she would be alive today.

It became unbearable for me so I tried Lyrica - worked wonders! I don't worry as much as I used to, I've started hanging out with friends again, I am just a happier human being and feel much more like myself by now. Still, I've been experiencing side effects such as confusion and blurry vision, but nothing I wouldn't sacrifice for mental stability. I'm on 100mg three times a day. It's just the very beginning for me but I have high hopes and am pretty sure I'm finally on my way to fewer symptoms of my disorders! Read More Read Less",
903,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anonymous,,,On medication for 5 to less than 10 years ,Patient,Nerve Pain from Spinal Cord Injury ,3.7,"I'm 46 yr old male with fairly severe nerve pain in my feet and hands from diabetes as well as bouts of gout. I'm taking 75 mg 2xday now for about a year. It does give me a moderate amount of relief for the throbbing pain but not the shock type pains. I have to see about increasing but am scared of side effects and to be honest, I have had an addiction to opiates about 15 years ago and am afraid of getting addicted to Lyrica. I've been very careful at making sure I have not taken more than prescribed!
I have had some side effects that seem to subsided to a degree. I have experienced weight gain but I've also been thru a lot of depression relating to my personal life so it's hard to say exactly why. Diabetes also adds to my desire to eat sweets which I try my hardest to control. I also have noticed a decrease in libido, which again diabetes does as do other meds I take so it wouldn't be fair to blame Lyrica directly. Overall I think the medication can help to a degree but definitely not a cure all or if you suffer from an opioid misuse disorder, please be honest with your doctor and be honest with yourself while monitoring and taking this medicine. Good luck! Read More Read Less",

I take 150mg+ plus baclofen, topamax, alpha drugs, modafinil.
I have severe chronic fatigue which I've had basically my entire life but until the car accident it was manageable. At first lyrica gave me horrible swelling on top of what I had but now I do not notice. It does not affect my fatigue, I take 150mg in the morning in fact. It has made my mood better and I assume that has to do with less pain. I imagine if my energy levels were better I'd be a happy, normal, human being. I've been on so many drugs over the years I can stop and start anything without withdrawal. And I have no dependence on any drugs including opiates even after long term prescriptions.

My pain level is more manageable but still quite severe most of the time. I still cannot work or properly take care of all my responsibilities but the edge is taken off when I take baclofen. I have not had any noticeable side effects. My partner has taken it as well with very good results. Personally  I would recommend baclofen just be aware that it’s not a magic pill and it won’t take all your discomfort away for everyone, especially if your condition is severe but if you have exhausted other options such as massage, chiropractic work, or exercise try it out.

Is extremely helpful. One pill usually settles persistent muscle knots but I've found I don't get too drowsy or sleepy, and can still go about my day without feeling the siren call of a nap. However, I Have noticed that I've developed some tolerance of drug: whereas when I first took baclofen, 10mg would knock me out, now I can function normally with it while getting okay results for spasms. 2 pills (only used in extreme cases of spasms), however, now puts me in sleep mode. So far this isn't a problem but I am concerned that I've developed a tolerance

As yet I’m not ready to go one way or the other on this because I’ve not been taking it too long. Read More Read Less,

It has worked very well. I haven't had any side effects mentioned by other reviewers.I have to watch how much I eat as I can quickly get over full and have a lot of stomach discomfort for several hours. I frequently had an uncomfortable almost pain-like feeling in my stomach for no discernable reason starting 3 years ago. It lasted for 2 years. A test indicated stomach inflamation but when I was scoped 9 months later Dr said he couldn't see anything. I have had this sensation much less often over the last year. Don't know if any of this is due to Dexilant. I would have to go off it to tell. I had been on other PPI's for 6 years before starting Dexilant. I am 65 and will need a PPI for life.

I started looking into this as I was under the impression like so many that OCD was mainly ""hand washing"" compulsions. What it described was me. I mentioned it to my psychiatrist and he agreed with my therapist and weaned me off Lexapro and onto Prozac. It took a few months to get up to 80mg that I take each morning. After 40 years I can't say I feel normal because I don't know what ""normal"" is. But the depression, anxiety, anger outbursts and my OCD thoughts have gotten manageable.

I was desperate for relief, so I took (1) 4mg tab daily of Hydromorphone (only had 20 pills). I tried to get it refilled and my doctor refused. She told me to take Ibuprofen or Tylenol, which of course did nothing. Her colleague put me on Gabapentin, which has helped some, but not as well as the Hydromorphone. My main point here is that while some of us really need pain meds for a short time, we can't get them because of all the people abusing them. It's NOT right!! Something has to change!

I’m very careful and aware of medication side effects as well as my body’s reactions to things. I was prescribed this for “a possible kidney infection”. Turns out there was no kidney infection AT ALL and I’ve been on this medicine for nothing. 

I’m about 4 days in and absolutely done. The doctor prescribed this for a duration of 1 week, twice a day. I’ve noticed extreme dry throat and mouth, my upper lip was dry and itching, an insane urge to constantly urinate (which I did not have before), a strange sound in my left ear and random pain on the bottom of my foot. Initially I thought I was developing a secondary infection which created the constant urgency and sensation to urinate but upon further research I found journals online stating this medication does in fact behave as a potassium-sparing diruetic. Makes perfect sense. 

Be careful taking this!!!!!

I’ve never discontinued a medication but I’m completely done taking this. It’s horrific and dangerous. If it’s banned in the UK it should be banned here as well given how many people suffer on it. Read More Read Less",

As always, speak to your doctor about your concerns but this drug has been great for me. On a side note, I have been taking a B complex vitamin and a probiotic daily about 4-5 hours after my first dose. The probiotic helps replenish good bacteria in your gut which can be affected by antibiotics and the B complex vitamin, I read can help reduce potential side effects due the drugs ability to possibly block/lower folic acid and thiamine levels.

1047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Zach ,25-34 ,Male ,On medication for less than 1 month ,Patient,infection ,5.0,"Okay. So I’ve been an on and off IV drug user for around 10 years. Had two bad discs and that turned into lumbrosacral radiuculpathy L4, L5 and S1–I turned down surgery and began getting spinal injections of methylprednisolone and was put on 4 15mg oxy-ir’s a day and 60 Percocets a month for breakthrough pain—I started to have a break from my pain and because I tested for LESS oxycodone one my body than I should have—taking ALL of your pills apparently was/is a part of the contract that pain management clinics make you sign when they prescribe. 

ANYWAY—this is all to say that when they told me that they would no longer prescribe to me—I called up a buddy and asked him for some heroin to snort. But it wasn’t longer than 2 weeks before I started injecting, but when you overshoot your vein/miss it you will likely develop a strep or staph infection, depending on what all has touched the heroin OR if you reuse needles. This comes in the form of an abscess that can take on the size of a tennis ball—this has happened to me around 10 times to me—almost lost my right arm AND my left hand due to these abscesses. And the one where I almost lost my left hand I also had cellulitis running up my arm almost to my biceps…so each time this happened—well some of them I nursed at home, but each other time I went to the hospital and what did they put me on ALWAYS—BACTRIM DS!! And within 2.5 days symptoms were subsiding, by day 4 NO PAIN AT ALL. And by the end of each ten-day course, everything was all cleared up. The ONLY SIDE-EFFECTS that I had was some loose stool—nothing immodium couldn’t handle.

So—BOTTOM LINE: if you’re not allergic to sulfa drugs and not a problem unless you’re allergic to it or have certain other illnesses which may interact with the bactrim—you see THIS IS WHY ITS SO IMPORTANT TO TELL YOUR DOCTORS EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR HEALTH *BEFORE* they prescribe. Dr’s aren’t fortune-tellers, you have to be honest about WHAT the problem actually is, your prior/current health problems and ALL DRUGS AND SUPPLEMENTS that you take—INCLUDING ILLEGAL DRUGS.

Within 10 minutes the stomach quiteS itself and the liquid painful BM stops!  Together these drugs allow me to function a fairly normal life (until the next attack).  When taking mescopolam don’t take the whole pill. It’s a soft tablet and I just break off a third or less. That still works. If I take a whole one it gives me constpation. Just experiment with it and it will do you a first class job! For constipation I use magnesium gel capsules (the OTC kind they use as a supplement). It cleans you out overnight. If you don’t think your severely stopped up I just bite the end off the gel cap and squeeze some of the white magnesium out so I don’t get a full dose. Again just experiment.

I've had disregulated sleep for most of my life.  It might be related to anxiety, constant body aches, street noise, or it might be independent of all that.  But I was at the point where I couldn't treat my anxiety or even do more with my life than work, eat, and sleep because I was so tired all the time -- not sleeping at night, then unable to get up in the morning.  Taking half a lorazepam at night sometimes helped, but it wasn't a good long-term solution.  My psychiatrist told me that if I routinely found myself using lorazepam 3 or more nights a week to get to sleep on time, I should fill a Rx for trazodone and take half a pill nightly, instead, up to a whole pill if half wasn't effective. 

It has truly changed my life.  I know it's probably a temporary fix, but for now, I can just take it after dinner and reliably wind down over the next 1-2 hours.  You hit a point where you're almost dizzy sleepy, and that's when you want to promptly get into bed.  Taking it made me realize that I haven't been naturally ""starting to feel sleepy"" since maybe 10th grade, and the lack of that sensation was causing me to NOT want to brush my teeth, get into pajamas, wrap up what I was doing, and climb into bed at night, because I literally felt no physical desire to.  With trazodone, now I do, and maybe I can start retraining my body into it once more, if therapy and meds in combo can start to alleviate my anxiety -- which is turning out to be less body-chemistry-based and more situational than I had realized. 

It also doesn't cause me any drowsiness or ""drug hangover"" the next day -- it gets out of your system easily.  In fact, the only complaint I have is that you can sort of ""miss your window"" with it,  if you put off going to bed for too long. 

My tips would be: 
* Start with a low dose and see how much you need.  
* Don't give up if you experience some mild side effects at first.  It gave me _serious_ drymouth for the first two weeks, but then it just cleared up completely once my body had adjusted to the med.
* Take it after eating dinner or a significant snack.  It hits me HARD if I take it on an empty stomach -- after 10 minutes, it hits all at once and I feel like I'm going to fall over (although I don't).  (That sort of extreme feeling can kick your anxiety into overdrive, too, so it isn't necessarily the trazodone causing racing heart or panic or diarrhea, etc.)  But after a full dinner, it gives me a nice easy 2-hour descent into sleepiness. 

Good luck to everyone, and I hope you all find the treatment plans that work best for each and every one of you.  Read More Read Less",

I stopped taking Trazodone after getting another UTI, which may have actually been me passing a kidney stone. I was only taking 1/2 tablet a night… 25 mg. People take 300+ mg for depression.

I thought I could go back to work Wednesday, but no. This medication makes me extremely tired and extremely dizzy. My cough isn’t AS bad but is still very much present. My lungs feel bruised from all the coughing. Sometimes a sharp pain sears through but not as bad as before meds. 
Anyway, I cannot focus or concentrate. I forget what things are such as when sweeping and asking my son for the dustpan. I couldn’t remember DUSTPAN. (Female, mid 30’s).
I am finally able to sleep through the night without waking up every 20-40min in a coughing fit. I can’t complain about that. But I am unable to cough up mucus and my chest still feels tight. The cough has become an itchy throat one instead of deep lung. About 20 minutes after taking a dose, I can’t keep my eyes open, even when standing up. I have to lay down. I had a headache from the bronchitis to begin with but this isn’t helping with that at all. Oh and I have severe heartburn that tums don’t come close to touching. My upper arms are also achy and bruised feeling. My limbs feel tired most of the time and my right foot did get really tingly often today which I read can be a rare side effect. Maybe too much sleeping. I’m not sure.

OVERALL: the dizziness and confusion isn’t unbearable as it is accompanied by exhaustion so I’ve just been sleeping a ton - can’t be dizzy in my sleep!

1155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RS ,65-74 ,Female ,On medication for less than 1 month ,Patient,Cough ,4.7,"This was prescribed as a first line attempt to prevent my chronic migraines that were only occasionally responsive to triptans. It did NOTHING for the migraines.

I took it for 4 years increasing over time from 37.5mg to 225mg. Worst mistake of my life. 

It turned me into a shell of my former self. Just a numb zombie. Chronic fatigue like nothing I have ever experienced led to weight gain of 35 pounds in shy of two years. 
Yes if you miss a dose, it will let you know… but what’s worse is, someday you will need to come off of this. (It causes liver issues over the long term also.) Then you will find out what living hell is. Weaning off was taken in baby steps over a year. I’m talking about taking just a couple beads out of the capsule every few days… and yet I had brain zaps, visual disturbances, brain fog, trouble articulating thoughts, unceasing exhaustion and felt like I had been transplanted into the body of an 80 year old woman with arthritis. The withdrawal effects were so bad I often found myself sitting at the dosage I had gotten to for weeks at a time out of fear of the impending worsening doom. I’m not exaggerating when I say the suffering was relentless for a year.
It gave me an interesting perspective what it must be like in terms of difficulty for heroin addicts to get off and stay off when they know that hit will make the pain go away. 

It’s now been a year and a half since I’ve been on it, and I am only just now truly starting to get back to myself. Once I had finally weaned off completely, I still found myself dealing with the ungodly amount of weight I had gained, joint pain, general stiffness, all over pain… my mind was dull and I wasn’t nearly as sharp as I had once been. I had no desire to do day to day things and was still exhausted in spite of a healthy whole food based diet, regular exercise, 6+ hours outside in the sunshine. THATS *IF* I could get myself out of bed and stay out of bed. 

I feel like this drug robbed me of some cognitive abilities that I think I will never regain. Not only that but it robbed me of 5 years of my life and was torture for myself and my loved ones to get off.

NO ONE… NOT MY DOCTOR, NOT MY PHARMACIST WARNED ME ABOUT THE HELL THAT WOULD AWAIT ME WHEN IT WAS TIME TO COME OFF THIS POISON.

I’m also in recovery for alcohol and drug addiction.
so needless to say this isn’t the only medication I take. I also take ativan, seroqel, ritalin, wellbutrin, clonidine, and other medications for different health issues i’m dealing with.
At first this medication was a game changer. Mind you, that was a long time ago. i’ve been on it so long now i don’t know if it still has the same effect because of everything else i’m on and the abuse I did to myself with my alcohol and drug addiction.
Even through my addiction I made sure to still take my medication, if I don’t take it within an hour of my scheduled time I would start to get a headache and have major side effects within hours of missing a dose.
If i don’t take it at all in a day, the next morning my body is completely seized. I would literally have to get help to get up. 
I don’t even know if this medication is even working anymore but I definitely don’t miss a dose. I’m scared to decrease my dose in order to come off it because the side effects are so severe. I wish there was something I could take to ease the side effects while coming off this medication.

It seems that I have been prescribed anything and everything. Nothing has worked very good. Doctor prescribed Effexor 150mg to be taken 3x day in September. After a few weeks, I was going absolutely crazy and thought I was crawling out of my skin. We made a few adjustments but not much. In late October, I blacked out and crashed my Honda Accord into a box truck. I came to when the accident happened. In November, I thought people were coming after me. I saw people and spent two full days chasing cars and trying to get away from them. Thankfully my ex-wife was called to get me and take me to the hospital. I tested positive for PCP at the hospital to which law enforcement were notified. The test later confirmed it was the Effexor. The two days in the ER - I didn't sleep any because I thought the nurses were going to gag and bag me. Regardless of the sleep meds they gave me, I fought like hell to not go to sleep. At some point, I fell asleep and woke up in the back of a constable's vehicle. My hands and legs were tied up. I freaked out. Quickly, the constable told me he was taken me downtown to a hospital. That eased my mind. As soon as I was in the psych ward, they took away the Effexor. I will never take this medicine again. I'm sure it works for many but the psychotic behavior I experienced has not escaped my mind because it was so scary. The meds they have me on now seem to be working along with a lot of prayer.

2021 - present Effexor 

I had almost suffered to the false reality that I was beyond help. I did everything the doctors told me to do: eat right, exercise, spirituality, support groups, etc. Nothing seemed to help until January 2021 when I was placed on Effexor. 

I can’t find words to explain how much better I feel. I don’t flip and have panic attacks. I don’t find away for months on end. I finally know how it feels to be normal. Read More Read Less",
1166,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MigraineMomma ,35-44 ,Female ,On medication for 5 to less than 10 years ,Patient,Other ,1.7,I have been taking this medication for almost 20 years. I don’t feel it has helped my depression but due to horrific withdrawals I have been unable to get off of it. I have recently found out I have Cirrhosis of my liver and being a non drinker this was a huge shock for me. I have had test upon test and so far there is no explanation as to how I got this terrible disease. I thought I would Google the effects of Effexor XR on the liver and what a surprise! This drug is known to cause serious liver damage! I wasn’t in the right state of mind to Google the effects of it when I first starting taking it and I feel my doctor or the makers of it should make this VERY CLEAR when it’s prescribed! How many other people are in the same position as me and have no idea what this drug can do to them. Read More Read Less,

I had trouble focusing and paying attention but now I'm doing so well in college I'm making As and Bs now.

I did not experience bad feelings by reducing myself the number of bowls contained in the pills. You can ask some pharmacies to prepare it i think (tbc).

Sometimes I take it when I have a tension headache along with ibuprofen in the hopes it will help some. It's hit or miss there since I have headaches and migraines a lot.,

Tizanidine 4 mgs was short acting and I woke up at 3am, like a light switch.
Then I was switched to 750mgs Methacarbamol 4 X’s a day and I’m thinking if this lasts, I can postpone my cervical decompression surgery.
It would be posterior due to a 4 level ACDF that was done in 2010.
Those surgeries are waaay more painful since muscle is cut. 
Hospitals are so mean after these aggressive surgeries, I’m trying to delay it with muscle relaxers and medical cannabis concentrate in a capsule BID.

Taking a combination of methocarbamol and acetaminophen in the morning and again 6 hours before bedtime seems to help during the day and then I use a different muscle relaxant at night.,

I've been severely suffering from chronic pain syndrome for the past 20-plus years and have tried just about everything available.  Unfortunately, I'm also a rapid metabolizer of the vast majority of pain medications that I've tried. Very few pain medications (regardless of the dose) are truly effective at treating my condition.

It came back down but kept going back up doing simple stuff. I’m talking 161 HR Just going to do laundry. I finally called my Dr and told her to take me back to Jardiance.

1191,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anonymous ,35-44 ,Female ,On medication for less than 1 month ,Patient,Other ,1.7,"I have been on Trulicity for 15 months now. I have a love-hate relationship with it.

Due to severe side-effects and the fact that I responded to it so quickly, my dosage was never increased. My A1c had suddenly jumped to 8.6 after being in the high 6-low 7 range with the help of Metformin and Tradjenta for couple of years. 

My A1c dropped quickly and my last one was 5.7. I have also lost 31 pounds which was much needed!

That’s the love part. For me it works extremely well, even at the lowest dose.

The hate part is the terrible side-effects. Apparently I am not “most people”. While they are not as intense as they were initially, they are definitely still an issue. 

I am keeping my fingers crossed. The past three weeks, though not without side-effects completely, have been the best I have had this far and hopefully the trend will continue!

If so, my perseverance will have been paid off. Rather than switch to something which may have the same or even a worse effect and not been as effective, I made the decision to grab the beast by the horns and try to figure out and take note of what worked and what didn’t. For example, though it sounds counterproductive, keeping a little something in my stomach actually seems to help so for about three days I eat small meals supplemented with light snacks about every two hours. 

It is a love-hate relationship that has been going on for more than a year and finally it is showing some indication that finally it may be slowly improving.Read More Read Less",

Week 2 bad constipation again, smelly vomit burps and farts again, bloating and stomach lains continue, had to take something again to make me have a bowel movement. Week 3 started having small soft bowel movements every day and again smelly vomit burps and farts, atill bloated and stomach pains. Week 4 took the injection on Sunday again. Monday night started having diarrhea still bloated and stomach pains and vomit that was yellow and foamy. Tuesday felt like I was peeing out my butt cuz of the diarrhea being so runny. And this is several times an hour and a lot of it. Tuesday afternoon I realize I hadn't peed since about 12:30am. I was so dehydrated and nothing would stay in me. It ran right through me. Tuesday evening Went to the er to get fluids to hydrate me. 2 bags of fluids still couldn't go pee. Everything i was tested for was negative. I couldn't pee for about a total of 36 hrs. I didnt pee until Wednesday late morning. I get ahold of my doc she thinks it's just a stomach bug and not related to the meds. Knowing my body I knew it was the med. So I decided to try 1 more time. So Sunday rolls around I try it again. Tuesday diarrhea again, smelly vomit burps, bad stomach pains again can't sleep from it and super bloated again. Thursday and still having diarrhea. I'm done with this med. Terrible experience I don't recommend it at all to anybody. It makes food sit in your stomach for a few days so you feel full and I don't do well with food sitting in my stomach like that.

1209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Snow_lover ,45-54 ,Male ,On medication for 1 to 6 months ,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ,5.0,"My husband has a different type of depression, and his experience was more like the negative review, with anger and too wound up, so he stopped. I had the opposite experience. It is my ""go-to"" for major depression. I do not like taking pharmaceuticals, and prefer holistic approaches that work around that, but Wellbutrin is the only antidepressant that brings me up to a functional level and out of the deep black hole depression that so negatively effects me and makes life feel not worth it. I have my husband, my cat, friends and family, and strong spiritual practices and beliefs that include meditation, deep breathing, and connecting to Source. When my chemistry pulls me down, it is so difficult to function, even with these good things and people in my life. These loved ones notice that I am better for taking Wellbutrin. I also get acupuncture regularly since 2007.

I believe we each have individual responses to ""what goes in,"" i.e., food, supplements, medications, etc. So if someone else decides to try this, I would say to work closely with a trusted doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, to monitor the effects, and find it useful, or find it doesn't work for you. 

I take 100mg once daily in the morning. I'm grateful to have Wellbutrin. I have taken it, and been weaned off of it with my doctor's support, on and off since 2000. So I wasn't sure how to answer the question since there have been years since 2000 where I didn't need it.Read More Read Less",

I was so tired I could only do the bare minimum in life. I couldn’t keep up with cleaning, I could barely cook food, I couldn’t focus or concentrate on anything, I had a very short term memory, I couldn’t take care of my personal hygiene at all. My hair was matted or greasy all the time, I looked about 10 years older than I am, I had bad anxiety and would get panic attacks daily, my skin was always broken out because I just didn’t have it in me to take care of myself. I was extremely underweight and couldn’t put any on. Important things in my life weren’t being done, like bills getting paid on time. I was a complete mess and thought I was slowly dying, because of how badly it all affected my body. It affected my energy level so badly that I couldn’t get out of bed for weeks at a time. I barely had the strength to roll over at times. I was always irritated, and would flip out and rage at the drop of a hat, then experience extreme guilt. My relationship was falling apart because of this, I have no idea why he stayed. I had no desire for any sexual activity. The thought of it was repulsive to me. I didn’t want to be touched by anyone, not even hugs goodbye. I wish I had gone to a psychiatrist sooner. This medication has pulled me out of the dark hole I was in. I have energy again. I’m able to clean and organize my living space, I can cook every day, I shower on a regular basis now, I can concentrate, and I’m able to take care of all of the important things in my life again. My libido seems to have returned as as well. I feel love and desire for my partner again. This medication was an add on to the SSRI I was taking. My current dose is 100mg twice daily. The first 4 days were weird, but it wasn’t any worse than I was already feeling.  I called it “emotionally uncomfortable”. After about 2 weeks I noticed how much better I was feeling. I haven’t experienced many side effects. I was dizzy, and had a bit of dry mouth, for the first couple weeks. I do experience regular constipation, and dizziness every now and then, and I have some insomnia but it’s better than the insomnia I had prior. The minimum side effects are worth it! I was a shell of a person before I started taking this. Read More Read Less",

I feel like I can get out of bed and do things now. I have also lost a lot of weight, and I am no longer a frequent binge-eater. In my first year taking Wellbutrin, I've lost around 65lbs. I am 5'3 and weighed around 170lbs when I started taking wellbutrin, and now my weight has been around 105lbs for over 5 months. This has greatly helped my self esteem and self-hatred, and i am so grateful. However, i am very sensitive to side effects and I have developed horrible tinnitus, and due to combining this medication with lithium, I now have blurry vision, tremors, dry mouth, hair loss, and other things. Also, since I started taking wellbutrin, my bowel issues have only gotten worse. I am now constantly constipated and I have cramps all the time. But the side effects are worth it.

Called pharmacist who said this drug is ""activating"" you need non-activating"".  A bit of research found that bupropion XL is NOT for anxiety and will make it worse!  Stopped taking immediately. Saw a cardiologist & had tests which were all OK, He concluded I had a panic attack & ""could"" be from bupropion. It took a few weeks to feel ""better"".

Mild dizziness when I wake up from my usual 2-5hr sleep. I function fine for work but the weight loss and malnourishment has made me weak. I am seeing a DR today (it's 4am btw) to be taken off this medication as I havent been this depressed with suicidal ideation before and the blend of all these side effects are not conducive to me getting better. It took 10 days to go from being depressed and otherwise healthy to underweight, paranoid, insomniac, hyper depressed, tweaking, shaking and very very angry and rude.

This is the only medication that has continued to be effective against my depression over the years.  Others have come and gone.  It worked better for me when I was also taking Zoloft, but after years I had problems with dizziness from the Zoloft.  Now I just take bupropion at 300mg/day.  I take it in the morning so it will not disturb my sleep.  It gives me more energy as well as freedom from depression.

Bupropion has been a lifesaver for me.  Any medication affects different people in different ways.  I am not having detrimental side effect but someone else may.

I will say, it helped improve my motivation and energy levels.  I was struggling to get out of bed to go to a job I hated; however, after only taking a few doses, I was waking up early and functioning on 5 hrs. of sleep (or less) throughout the week.

About a year in my anxiety was terrible, intrusive thought. One day at work I had a crunch and no longer could walk. Found out I had Avascular Necrosis (lack of blood supply to my joint) not able to figure out the source, I was ""an anomaly "". At 38yrs old I got a left full hip replacement. Any time my pain got bad my heartrate started going up but I was on an anti muscle spasms muscle relaxer which would calm the pain and get my heartrate back to normal. Then as my right hip went out my heartrate would get so out of control I was in the ER at least once a month HR at 170 throwing up in agony. At 39 full right hip replacement  (all during covid) Now at 40 I just had my right knee replaced. I moved back home this past year. I put on 100lbs in past 3 years always stressed and broken. Now anxiety has me unknowingly scratch at my arms at red bumps. Cut off fingernails and meditate. Can't take anxiety meds cuz of painkillers from surgery.

Initially I took 0.6 mg colchicine pills, one per day for three days, which helped but the extreme pain did not all go away. Initially I did not take methylprednisolone, because the dosage indicated that I had to take 12 pills in a continuous sequence, yet my pain was getting better. Then I saw my kidney doctor who said that I could just take one or two pills per day and stop whenever the pain is gone. It worked very well to remove my pain after just five pills (in 2-1-1-1 for four days). A few days later the pain returned somewhat and I took a pill a day for three more days and the pain was gone again.  I had no obvious side effects, but do not yet know whether my CKD had gotten worse as a result of this event. I will recommend this medicine to others.

My body reacts strongly to poison ivy so just using topical creams and sprays doesn't work well at all. The doctor will give me a shot at the office that has 125mg. That's pretty strong and shuts down the intensity within a few hours. Then with topical creams for the itching I can sleep. Then I take the step down dose of the pills (10mg/ea) starting the next day for 6 days. 6-5-4-3-2-1. By day 2 or 3 it is very manageable.

The side affects that I get are usually being wound up so I stop drinking caffeinated products while I'm on it. A dose of benadryl tablet before bedtime and I can sleep.

It isn't perfect but no medicine is. I've used this as needed for over 10 years and it never fails to get the job done.

I became paranoid, I was having obsessive thoughts, I was scared to go to bed at night, I would wake up with night sweats and my heart beating out of my chest. I was even noticing my face twitching. With the advice of my doctor we went back to my original dose but was still feeling like my anxiety was at an all time high. It felt as though not only was this med not touching my anxiety but making me crazy. I tapered off to nothing. This is my first day with not taking this medication and I feel like my brain turned back on, I have interest in things again, I feel energetic, my heart isn't racing, I'm not having obsessive thoughts.

A couple of days after finishing this, I had I complete mental breakdown. It felt like adrenaline was rushing through my body. I couldn't watch tv, I couldn't play on my phone, I couldn't concentrate anything. I was so anxious and felt so out of body with brain fog, I almost wanted to admit myself. I started getting like internal tremors and them heart started racing like crazy. I went to the ER because I felt so ""off"" I had two episodes in the ER of SVT which has never happened to me before. I also had another episode once I got home. I've been off metro for about a month now and thankfully I feel like most of my symptoms have resolved but theres actually a FB group for people that have been destroyed by this medication. So I consider myself lucky. I will never take another medication again without doing research. I also will never take metro again unless my life absolutely depends on it- even then..idk. This drug can really mess some people up. I'm not saying it will do the same for you, but please do research & take thiamine and magnesium while taking it as it depletes your body of these causing central nervous issues. My SVT issues have also resolved which leads me to believe it was also caused by the drug. Read More Read Less",

I’ve not found the taste of the tablet to be an issue but noticed it has just made me feel very nauseous after having a dosage. I’ve been very tired and having to nap during the day due to low energy and earlier today had an awful experience where I felt my chest pains were so painful and my body felt it was just shutting down. Had to lay in bed with a hot water bottle and just wait for it to pass. Was on the verge of calling for an ambulance. It’s been an awful week and I’ve had to throw the towel in. After 5 and a half days. I was supposed to take them for 7 days but don’t think I can continue any more.

Day3: slight headache, a hour of dizziness, no appetite. 
Day 4: Headache, just feel ugh, nauseated, really tired for no reason. Almost like a small tummy virus feeling.

I read reviews on here before hand so I'm thankful it hasn't been to bad, Just a few days left so I'll stick it out.

First off, I had no appetite and everything I ate had a metallic taste. To be fair, I lost 15 pounds (""ain't nobody mad about that!"") and the worst side effect was to my vision.  I finished the Rx. 11/21/22, and am still suffering from eye issues. My eyes are so supersensitive to light, whereas they never had been prior to this Rx.  Also, my eyes are extremely dry and ache all the time. It's a shame to have to wear sunglasses inside because your eyes hurt from the light, or worse yet, having to wear huge sunglasses (think ""Maxine"" on the greeting cards) over your regular Rx sunglasses simply, because you can't stand the bright light and pain.

1350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anonymous ,25-34 ,Female ,On medication for less than 1 month ,Patient,Vaginosis caused by Bacteria ,3.0,"I was on this for almost 5 years. I was very depressed when the psychiatrist gave me this, and it seemed to kick in right away. I felt great for a few weeks on it. Increased mood, productivity, and increased sex drive and better orgasms. As time went on, the effects began to lessen to where I no longer felt that it made much of a difference. I was on 300mg and I was not going to increase it, but I continued taking it. 
Looking back, I think it elevated my anxiety because I started avoiding people on the street thinking they would attack me after watching some True Crime youtube videos, and I started experiencing a fear of flying when I had never been afraid to get on a plane before. Then last spring, my dad was diagnosed with myeloma, which gave me severe health anxiety. My anxiety was through the roof, I had panic attacks, and literally felt like I would die any minute. There was a tiger in the bushes and I needed to flee. My GP ordered a blood test and they found a very high amount of Wellbutrin in my system. She decreased my dose to 150mg. I then discussed it with a new psychiatrist and he told me to stop taking it. From my own research, I concluded that, since it acts on noradrenaline, it was basically keeping me in fight or flight at all time. I told my doctor this and he said that was correct. My anxiety got so much better after I stopped Wellbutrin.

Bottom line: if you just have depression, it's good. If you also have anxiety, I would advise you to stay away or get a low dosage until you find out how it affects you.Read More Read Less",

1359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anonymous,,,On medication for less than 1 month ,Patient,Vaginosis caused by Bacteria ,2.0,"Hi everyone. I’m a very healthy 25 year old and this drug, on the FOURTH DAY of taking it, caused me a lot of harm. I was driving home, everything was totally fine, not stressed at all, and then ALL of a sudden- I got dizzy, couldn’t breathe, and almost passed out. Luckily I was able to quickly pull over and call 911. At this point I was shaking uncontrollably, couldn’t swallow my own spit, hyperventilating and still feeling like passing out. My hands and feet were purple and freezing. For the first time in my life I had to go to the ER, and was taken there in an ambulance. Once getting there, for a little while I felt pretty calm, so I thought I should probably just go home instead of being treated. But shortly after, another of these “panic attack” type things came on. This repeated 5 more times at the hospital while they ran tests. (Everything came back normal but blood pressure was very high as well as my pulse at times).  eventually they gave me Ativan and then shot me up with Midazolam (a sedative) in order to get my heart rate back down. It was truly terrifying, I was really scared that I was going to have a seizure or something or even die. Reading some of these reviews of the times it worked for people made me really want to try out this anti-depressant but PLEASE re-consider if you want to save yourself thousands of dollars in ER bills.

1360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Melissa Richardson ,25-34 ,Female ,,Patient,Bipolar Depression ,1.0,"I started Wellbutrin 150 mg approximately  1.5 months ago. Prior to starting this anti-depressant I was crying uncontrollably everyday for weeks, I had no motivation, nothing brought me joy, and had loss of focus and productivity. On the 1st week of taking Wellbutrin 150mg I experienced ínstense headaches and nausea & not much change in my depressed behavior. By the 2nd week, I felt better, more enthusiastic and headache & nausea was gone. Despite not being sad anymore, I still didn’t feel happy. It was like an in between; however it did help minimize my anxiety & irritability. Now fast forward a month later and my MD increased my dose to 350mg. I have reverted back to my depressed self prior to starting the medication all together. Not sure if it’s temporary but it’s been a week now and I’m fighting back tears throughout the day and I’m nauseous all the time with occasional headaches & loss of motivation. I feel helpless and my intrusive thoughts have come back. Had anyone else experienced this after increasing their dose of Wellbutrin?Read More Read Less",

Made the switch to Wellbutrin because I found that taking SSRI's made me incredibly anxious, numb feeling and killed my sex drive. For the first few months on Wellbutrin at 150mg, I noticed a high heart rate, dilated pupils (so light sensitivity), and I had a very hard time sleeping. I didn't drink much but when I did I would have a terrible headache the next day which didn't happen before. BUT after 3 months these symptoms almost all but left. My libedo returned, my mood stabilized and I had a lot more energy in the morning. I also found I had less food cravings which was nice cause I would tend to overeat when I was in a mood. When i upped my dose to 300mg my earlier symptoms returned but only for about a month. Overall very happy with this medication and would recommend it for anyone who has had a hard time using SSRIs!

I thought since it’s supposed to inhibit dopamine reuptake, there would at least be a slight increase in reward or motivation. No. One small Diet Coke, which really doesn’t do much (slight caffeine), does more to make me feel better in one hour than the Wellbutrin did for me at all in the two months I’ve been taking it!!

The doubling of dose was due to my increased hypertension. At 5.0 I noticed a dramatic increase in extreme tiredness and dizziness.  I lost motivation to get my daily chores done.  The increase in dose really did not help decrease my high blood pressure either!  I gained 5 pounds right away and have been unable to drop any weight even with extended water fasts of 3 days.  I did more research on other natural paths of controlling my BP and discovered the miracles of Magnesium.  After just 3 days my BP went from 140-150 (systolic) to now 120-135.  Diastolic numbers greatly improved too.  I halved my bystolic down to 2.5 and have maintained 120/80 range.  My goal is to increase my stores of magnesium with time and hopefully kick the bystolic.  Bystolic does help with mood swings (menapause) and anxiety to some extent. Overall my low dose is tolerable.  Some headaches and heavy legs due to water retention has also been experienced.

I would occasionally I miss a day  I would miss a few doses it didn't seem to make a difference so I decided to stop. I wanted to do that because I had taken it for a long period, I've been okay. 
Today 1.5 years later I decided the nerve pain is getting pretty intense again Monday I'll ask my doctor to restart Gabapentin. Again I will start at 100 and move up to 300 mg after time, that is how it is designed to take,  long-term. 
Starting at a 300 could defiantly create getting sick.The Best to All!

At first it was difficult to tolerate but that's because the dose was too strong. Once you find the dose that works for you, it really works great on my severe nerve pain. I adjust my dose as needed. I've been taking 400mg 3 x day, but have recently been prescribed 600mg. I'm supposed to take it four times a day but three times is enough for now. There was a time a few years ago that I was taking much more and also times that I just take it at night. It's just the nature of my issue so Gabapentin is easy to change doses as needed. The effect changes with coffee or certain types of food and definitely if you take other meds so be mindful of this. I take it with 5-10mg of baclofen and the two medications together work well. However, if I take them together more than once a day my body can't handle the combination and it will literally knock me out. You have to know what works for you.

I started methadone when I was 30-31 and am still on it, but have been decreasing a little each month to see how my body feels without it. The gabapentin has helped with the slight discomfort from the methadone reduction, but it's hard to gauge its full effectiveness until I'm off the methadone.

I was getting up 10 times a night. I literally tried every medication and even treatments like botox injections in the bladder with no success. Nothing worked. My bladder made me a hopeless insomniac. I felt I was doomed to never be able to get a night’s sleep again in my life. Until I suffered from a painful pinched nerve in my neck. I went to my family doctor who prescribed 300mg of Gabapentin to treat the pain. The Gabapentin did nothing to help my neck pain, but oddly I noticed it significantly reduction in the number times per night I needed to get up and pee. It was cut in half.  I was actually able to get some sleep! So, I did some research online and was surprised to find research articles about the successful use of Gabapentin to treat nocturia.  I told my Urologists about what I had discovered. They knew nothing about the off label use of Gabapentin to treat Nocturia. I had to educate them! WTF! So, for the last few years since I have been taking 300 Gabapentin at bed time with positive results. I still get up to urinate more than most people, but my condition has improved greatly and I can sleep now. Interestingly, I also was suffering from restless legs syndrome at bed time previously and that condition completely gone away when I started taking Gabapentin. Fortunately I have not experienced any of the negative side effects some people do with Gabapentin. There is one other important thing that played a role in my finding a solution to my condition. Prayer! I was suffering, desperate and at wits end to find a solution. I would ask God to guide me so I could find an effective treatment and I did. So, in hindsight, I believe God gave me that awful pinched nerve so I could find Gabapentin as the solution my Urologist could not. Just sayin ??Read More Read Less",
